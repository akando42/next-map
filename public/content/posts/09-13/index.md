So since when and why Friday the Thirteen generate so much fear and superstition. Loki is a Norse god of mischief. Once upon a time at the party of the Gods at the Valhalla, Lowki walked in the party as the 13th god crossing the gate of Norse Heaven. By the time he stepped his left foot through the gate, the universe suddenly experienced a full eclipse and the party's over. The Moon covered the Sun and everything turned into darkness. 

All the gods and their power rendered useless under eclipse while Lowski got much more powerful and enhanced under eclipse. Lowski used his power to plunge the world into chaos and darkness. There are also 13 people at the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus shared with his Apostle before his crucifixion. 

With so much effort to exhaust control over our enviroment by building human systems that ensures human foundational needs of air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing and reproduction, the basic things that most thriving animal species could achieve without high level cognitive power, once upon a while, we again lost control, civilizations collapsed and societies fallen into chaos.

An anchor shooting out 3 arrows at the same time are definitely a bad luck for his opponents. 

Maybe simply in a fight, one against 3 is a pretty bad situation for an average person. However one guy with 3 girls is a pretty exciting situation but the next morning the guy will be very tired and exhausted. 

Interesting enough, 4 US presidents were part of the Thirteen Club ( Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison and Theodore Roosevelt.  The Thirteen Club is an exclusive society that dines a 13-course dinner on the 13th day of the month in room 13 at the Knickerbocker Cottage.
