So since when and why Friday the Thirteen generate so much fear and superstition. Loki is a Norse god of mischief. Once upon a time at the party of the Gods at the Valhalla, Loki walked in the party as the 13th god crossing the gate of Norse Heaven. By the time he stepped his left foot through the gate, the universe suddenly experienced a full eclipse and the party's over. The Moon covered the Sun and everything turned into darkness. 

All the gods and their power rendered useless under eclipse while Lowski got much more powerful and enhanced under eclipse. Loki used his power to plunge the world into chaos and darkness. There are also 13 people at the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus shared with his Apostle before his crucifixion. 

With so much effort to exhaust control over our enviroment by building human systems that ensures human foundational needs of air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing and reproduction, the basic things that most thriving animal species could achieve without high level cognitive power, once upon a while, we again lost control, civilizations collapsed and societies fallen into chaos. 

Many other times though, it is the human genetics group that built systems that other DNA lineages living in, who has too much power and control, take away the foundational needs of other human because that was as easy as taking a breath. 

### Fire, Gold, Blonde and the Nordic Domination of Europe

The human condition has a major improvement with our newly acquired ability to create and control fire. No other species in the animal kingdom has the ability to control fire. With fire, it becomes much easier turn other animals and plants into easily digestible food sources, scare other predatory animal aways and staying warm and safe at night. 

Fire probably turns human from a fruit and vegetable picking primates into a meat eating predator.  Human is not the strongest, fastest animal nor has sharp teeth and claw. However, we can create fire and use it to scare even the largest and most dangerous land predator away like Tigers, Lions, Wolfs, Snakes, etcs. 

With only 12 hours or less of Sunlight, human without night vision of tigers, wolfs, snakes or owls becomes very vulnerable at night.
We can not easily see or keep ourselves warm at night. Before the invention of fire, human population growth is probably extremely slow with most of infants or young children dying off to the cold, lack of food and other dangerous predators. 

Fire and its yellow golden color probably becomes a crucial elements in every culture and religous rituals around the globe. So probably when for the first time, a human tribe in England saw a blonde human for the first time, they would immediately and subconciously assosiate these blonde men and women to something supernatural or god-like. When you can instill so much fear and respect on a foreign tribe without taking any actions, half of the battle is won.

With the harsh and cold winter of Scandinavia, the Scandinavian tribes probably have bigger built and much higher stamina than the Central and Southern European tribes. Plus the golden hair, the Scandinavian tribes already won the psychologial war before even throwing an axes or shooting an arrows. The most difficult tasks was probably designing an ocean fairing Viking boats. After the Viking boats, all the battles in Europe was easily won with Viking stamina and the obedience of local population was easily acquired with the blonde hair. The Nordic Viking genetics lineage was quickly multipled through the Central European Germanic tribes all the way to Southern Europe with the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

The Nordic genetics expansion only slowed down by the Nomadic Kazak tribes in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in 13 centuries but eventually these Kazak tribes fail to stop the Nordic blonde tribes of Russia to expand all the way to the Siberia and the Pacifics ocean. While blonde tribes are not numerous in number, being blonde is associated with royalty and the ruling classes of Europe. Even to the modern day, both Israel and United States first lady is Blonde and the President of European Union is also blonde.

All complex organism from plant, bacterial to human seeks more energy via light or other intermediate energy source comming from light like vegetable or other smaller organisms. Light gives direction to all complex organism with all organism has the tendency to move toward light sources and staying around the light sources. 

However, some human can create light sources, light reflecting materials or light emiting objects and position them to give directions to other humans, animals and plants. With modern human, for the first time, an organism can give itselves directions and no longer relying on nature to define meaning of its existence.
