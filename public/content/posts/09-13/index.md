So since when and why Friday the Thirteen generate so much fear and superstition. Loki is a Norse god of mischief. Once upon a time at the party of the Gods at the Valhalla, Lowki walked in the party as the 13th god crossing the gate of Norse Heaven. By the time he stepped his left foot through the gate, the universe suddenly experienced a full eclipse and the party's over. The Moon covered the Sun and everything turned into darkness. 

All the gods and their power rendered useless under eclipse while Lowski got much more powerful and enhanced under eclipse. Lowski used his power to plunge the world into chaos and darkness. There are also 13 people at the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus shared with his Apostle before his crucifixion. 

With so much effort to exhaust control over our enviroment by building human systems that ensures human foundational needs of air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing and reproduction, the basic things that most thriving animal species could achieve without high level cognitive power, once upon a while, we again lost control, civilizations collapsed and societies fallen into chaos. 

Many other times though, it is the human genetics group that built systems that other DNA lineages living in, who has too much power and control, take away the foundational needs of other human because that was as easy as taking a breath.
