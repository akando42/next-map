### The Urbanization Process of Coastal Cities
Urbanization process of East Asian countries started with Japan before WW2 and continues to accelerate into the 21 century. Most of the East Asian population started moving from their farming life in remote countryside to the new city life in urban cities along the coastlines.

Transportation infrastructure like highways, electrical power lines, water supply is much easier and cheaper to build around the flatland delta. Moving of export goods from sea ports via container ships to foreign markets and other local cities is also much cheaper than via land routes. 

The television images of city life draw millions of young adults from their spacy countryside homes to the crowded city apartment buildings. The farmers of East Asia gave up their ability to build homes, raise cattles and plant prices in exchange for new skills in manufacturing assembly, consumer services and office information processing.

The cities of light along East Asia Coastlines extended human productivity duration from 10 hours of daylight to 16 hours or more. Direct interaction with hundreds of coworkers and acquaintances resulted in exponential improvement in large group productivity growth. 

After the failed attempts of Japan and the Qing dynasty to dominate the United States and European Power during the Opium Wars, World War 1 and World War to achieve their Alpha status, Japan and other East Asia has accepted their Beta status. East Asia will be the manufacturer and producer of goods with limited defense capability while United States and NATO allies will be the Capital Investors with dominating defense capability. 

The comfortable city life with hundreds of options for everything from clothing to food, drink and entertainment within a walking distance also became a magnet that attracted East Asian females first from the mountain cities and deep inland towns to the coastal cities and then from the East Asian coastal cities to foreign lands of the United States and European nations.

The ability of United States Naval forces to both provide Air cover as well as threaten the East Asian coastal cities is essential for their ability to maintain their Alpha status over other East Asian powers. As a result, US Naval planners built exactly 01 Modern Nuclear Aircraft Carrier per major East Asian coastal cities. 

Not just providing protection, the United States also seeded East Asian YORK cities with their spermbank babies and provide a highly selective immigration pathways for these spermbank babies just like the way ancient Chinese Emperor would seed their protectorade cities with the King sperms and finally select the best son from these satelite cites for the emperor position. 


### Aircraft Carrier Evolution and Its Role in Naval Warfares
Aircraft carriers were a break-through during WWII and first used effectively and extensively by the British and Japanese Imperial Navy. It was a giant leap of innovation from the traditional large gun battleships. British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was able to sink the German largest battleship Bismark during the German battleship's first offensive operation in World War 2.

And the Japanese Imperial Navy was able to deal a heavy blow to the American battleships parked in Pearl Harbor with its 6 aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers gave naval force superior range as well as much more firepower and strike frequency than large gun battleships. The aircraft carriers with its torpedo and dive bombers are countless small attackers with striking range up to 300 kilometers while the battleships are slow and large targets with ability to strike only as far as the horizon of 30 kilometers or less.

The first aircraft carrier was built in the Engineering island of England, also quickly adopted by both the Japanese and American navy. Without any aircraft carriers, the German military was not able to control the North Atlantic Sea or severely disrupted the British supplyline. With a steel embargo, the Japanese Naval and Air Force was not able to armor their aircraft carriers as well the Mitsubishi Zero like the American and British which later contributed to the destruction of the Japanese Carrier Battle groups.

![Langley Class Aircraft Carrier](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/langley_class_carrier.png)

Langley was the first American aircraft carrier built by the American Military in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia in 1920 shortly after World War 1. The USS Langley has no Control Tower above the deck and can carry up to 36 aircrafts. The USS Langley served as both the first experimental mobile long range recon and attack platform for the United State Navy in the Caribbean and Australia from 1920 and 1942. The USS Langley has elevators to move aircrafts and ammunition as well as a medieval catapult-like device to launch aircrafts off the deck.

American with its vast economic resources and industrial output as well as ability to break the Japanese naval communication code eventually defeated the pioneer of aircraft carrier battle group - Japanese Imperial Navy.

America also took it to another level by adding fleet of latest jet-engine aircrafts and nuclear engines to the Aircraft Carrier battle group. Nuclear engine essentially gives aircraft carriers unlimited range. Last 70 years, America dominates the sea with its blue ocean navy and its superior technological as well as numerical aircraft carriers. Will aircraft carriers become obsolate like big gun battleships during WWII with the sunk of the Bismarck and Yamato. 

USS Forrestal supercarrier named after the first US Secretery of Defense - James Forrestal. It is the largest US Aircraft Carrier ever built and was the first to constructed with an angle flight deck, steam catapult and an optical landing system. USS Forrestal were among the last few US aircraft carriers with conventional engine. 

US Navy is currently operating 10 nuclear-powered Nimitz Class aircraft carriers.

The new aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was the 1st of its new class. Its construction begins on Nov 13, 2009 and finally commisioned by President Donald Trump July 22, 2017.

So America currently have 11 aircraft carriers in service, a larger fleet than the rest of 7 less advanced carriers from all other countries combined. 

All American carriers are nuclear-powered while only France has one nuclear-powered Aircraft Carrier. So is American still dominating the sea, well it is if sea power projection is based on Aircraft Carrier count.
