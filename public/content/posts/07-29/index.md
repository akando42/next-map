### The Urbanization Process of Coastal Cities
Urbanization process of East Asian countries started with Japan before WW2 and continues to accelerate into the 21 century. Most of the East Asian population started moving from their farming life in remote countryside to the new city life in urban cities along the coastlines.

Transportation infrastructure like highways, electrical power lines, water supply is much easier and cheaper to build around the flatland delta. Moving of export goods from sea ports via container ships to foreign markets and other local cities is also much cheaper than via land routes. 

The television images of city life draw millions of young adults from their spacy countryside homes to the crowded city apartment buildings. The farmers of East Asia gave up their ability to build homes, raise cattles and plant rices in exchange for new skills in manufacturing assembly, consumer services and office information processing.

The cities of light along East Asia Coastlines extended human productivity duration from 10 hours of daylight to 16 hours or more. Direct interaction with hundreds of coworkers and acquaintances resulted in exponential improvement in large group productivity growth. 

After the failed attempts of Japan and the Qing dynasty to dominate the United States and European Power during the Opium Wars, World War 1 and World War to achieve their Alpha status, Japan and other East Asia has accepted their Beta status. East Asia will be the manufacturer and producer of goods with limited defense capability while United States and NATO allies will be the Capital Investors with dominating defense capability. 

The comfortable city life with hundreds of options for everything from clothing to food, drink and entertainment within a walking distance also became a magnet that attracted East Asian females first from the mountain cities and deep inland towns to the coastal cities and then from the East Asian coastal cities to foreign lands of the United States and European nations.

The ability of United States Naval forces to both provide Air cover as well as threaten the East Asian coastal cities is essential for their ability to maintain their Alpha status over other East Asian powers. As a result, US Naval planners built exactly 01 Modern Nuclear Aircraft Carrier per major East Asian coastal cities. 

Not just providing protection, the United States also seeded East Asian YORK cities with their spermbank babies and provide a highly selective immigration pathways for these spermbank babies just like the way ancient Chinese Emperor would seed their protectorade cities with the King sperms and finally select the best son from these satelite cites for the emperor position. 


### Aircraft Carrier Evolution and Its Role in Naval Warfares
Aircraft carriers were a break-through during WWII and first used effectively and extensively by the British and Japanese Imperial Navy. It was a giant leap of innovation from the traditional large gun battleships. British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was able to sink the German largest battleship Bismark during the German battleship's first offensive operation in World War 2.  

![Bismark Battleships](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/Bismarck_Battleship.png)

And the Japanese Imperial Navy was able to deal a heavy blow to the American battleships parked in Pearl Harbor with its 6 aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers gave naval force superior range as well as much more firepower and strike frequency than large gun battleships. The aircraft carriers with its torpedo and dive bombers are countless small attackers with striking range up to 300 kilometers while the battleships are slow and large targets with ability to strike only as far as the horizon of 30 kilometers or less.    

![Japanese ZERO view during Pearl Harbor](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/american_battle_ships_in_pearl_harbor.png)

The first aircraft carrier was built in the Engineering island of England, also quickly adopted by both the Japanese and American navy. Without any aircraft carriers, the German military was not able to control the North Atlantic Sea or severely disrupted the British supplyline. With a steel embargo, the Japanese Naval and Air Force was not able to armor their aircraft carriers as well the Mitsubishi Zero like the American and British which later contributed to the destruction of the Japanese Carrier Battle groups.

Langley was the first American aircraft carrier built by the American Military in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia in 1920 shortly after World War 1. The USS Langley ***has no Control Tower above the deck*** and can carry up to 36 aircrafts. The USS Langley served as both the ***first experimental mobile long range recon and attack platform*** for the United State Navy in the Caribbean and Australia from 1920 and 1942. The USS Langley has elevators to move aircrafts and ammunition as well as a medieval catapult-like device to launch aircrafts off the deck.

After learning from the first experimental Langley Class Aircraft Carrier, the US navy built ***2 battle-grade aircraft carriers*** of the Lexington Class in early 1930s. The Lexington class carrier ***has an elevated Control Tower above the flight deck*** for easy monitoring of the battle space as well as managing the launching and recovery of aircrafts. Lexington class carrier can carry up to 78 aircrafts and ***still have 4 large battleship guns***  next to the control tower. The Lexington Class carrier was the first US Carrier be able to sink another Aircraft Carrier during the battle of Coral Sea against the Japanese Imperial Navy.

Yorktown Class Aircraft Carrier was the final aircraft carriers the United States Navy was able to finish before World War 2 and Pearl Harbor.
Three Aircraft Carriers of the Yorktown class saw the most actions during World WW2 against the Japanese Imperial Navy during the battle of Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal campaign. Yorktown class carriers have ***no large battleship guns*** to reduce weight and increase speed of the carrier. Yorktown Class Carrier class was also the first Aircraft Carrier with ***ship-borne search radar*** installed on  the Control Tower. The Yorktown class also comes with ***armor bell around the Waterline and Control Tower*** to limit damage from Japanese torpedos and bombers. These US armor Carriers were able to sustain heavy attacks from Japanese aircrafts and still come back to the frontline shortly after a repairing and refitting periods.

The Midway class was the Aircraft Carriers built right after the finish of World War 2 in 1945. These aircraft carriers come with full flight deck armor and waterline bell armor. The Midway class continued the innovation in Yorktown class with no large battleship guns, many anti-aircraft guns, upgraded search radar and upgraded aircrafts. The Midway class carriers saw action during the Korean war and Vietnam and had never been attacked or damaged by enemy aircrafts.

The Forrestal Super Carrier class named after the first US Secretery of Defense - James Forrestal. It is the among largest US Aircraft carrier ever built hance the Super Carrier classification. The Forrestal Supercarrier Class was the first to constructed with an angle flight deck, steam catapult and an optical landing system. The angle flight deck allows the carrier to recover landing aircrafts on the angle flight deck while still launching new aircrafts at the front flight deck with her steam catapult. The optical landing system allows aircrafts to land safely during low light condition as well as total darkness at night. USS Forrestal were among the last few US aircraft carriers with conventional fossil fuel engine. USS Forrestal was the only aircraft carrier ever been damaged after WW2 during an accidential missile launch above the fight deck.

The first Nimitz Class carriers was finished right after the Vietnam War. Nimitz class carriers were the first Nuclear-powered Aircraft Carrier classes. Nuclear-powered aircraft carrier allows the carrier to carry more Bombs and Missiles as well as larger Aircrafts with further attacking range. Nimitz long-range aircrafts puts the carrier outside the range of coastal radars, coastal artileries and even coastal land-based attack aircrafts.

![Nimitz Class Aircraft carrier](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/nimitz_class_carrier.png)

Nimitz class is a strategic transition of US Carrier role from a Sea control platform to a Coastal cities control platform. With the cutting edge US Radar and Satelite network, United States naval strike force is still alway be able to detect any hostile forces above the waterline first and launch their attacks first. The unlimited range US Nuclear-powered carrier can use her aircrafts to threaten any coastal cities along the Mediterian, Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and could be escorted by other unlimited-range nuclear-powered attack submarines like the Virginia or Los Angles class attack Submarines.

![Virginia Nuclear Attack Submarines](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/virginia_attack_submarines.png)

US Navy is currently operating 10 nuclear-powered Nimitz Class aircraft carriers. The Nimitz class carriers saw most actions during the Gulf War against Iraq military. While Nimitz aircrafts came under fire from Iraq airforces, the carrier itself was never in the firing range of any Iraqi aircrafts or naval ships.

The new aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was the 1st of its new class. Its construction begins on Nov 13, 2009 and finally commisioned by Donald Trump, the 45th President of United States July 22, 2017. FORD Aircraft Class Carrier comes with latest Surface and Air search radar, fully automated Close-In weapon defense system, electronic catapult launching system as well as a larger parking space at the tail to allow more Aircrafts load.

![Ford Class Aircraft carrier](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/ford_class_carrier.png)

So America currently have 11 aircraft carriers in service with 2 more Ford-class Carriers under construction, a larger fleet than the rest of 7 less advanced carriers from all other countries combined. All American carriers are nuclear-powered while only France has one nuclear-powered Aircraft Carrier. US Navy is not only still dominating the sea but be able to threaten most coastal cities while still staying out of range for any form of counter attacks.

### Aircraft Carrier Strike Group Composition

![Carrier Strike Group](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/US_Carrier_Strike_Group.png)

The only vulnerability to US nuclear-powered is her Fossil-fuel escort Destroyers and Cruisers. US nuclear-power Carrier with her unlimited range could be targeted by enemy long-range ballistic missiles and hypersonic cruise missiles while the protective parameter was compromised by out-of-fuel Destroyers or Crussiers.
