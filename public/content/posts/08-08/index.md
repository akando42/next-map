### The Genesis of Money
 
Money is essentially a mean for value exchange aka trading among individuals, groups, corporations or nations. 
 
It is a third party middle man, a medium that we all can believe in regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality or age. Money does not discriminate. 
 
It is one of the human greatest inventions to exponentially foster collaboration in large number. 

Chimpanzees do not have a monetary system and we do not see chimpanzees exchange bananas either. 
 
Nowadays, not a single human knows exactly how to make a pencil. And for sure, no one or even a nation can make a Boeing without importing manufacturing parts from another nation. 
 
However, with the help of money, we can all work together without knowing each other in order to collaboratively create a pencil or a space rocket.
 
Money has many forms throughout its history from stones, seashells to copper coins, silver, gold, fiat or paper money and mostly digital in the modern banking system.
 
### The Gold Rush

From the medieval age, gold becomes a common medium of exchange across different cultures. 
 
Gold has certain properties which make it a great medium of exchange:

It is wanted and sought after across different cultures and nations. The Chinese wants gold, the Spanish likes gold, the Persian values gold.
It is difficult to fake or easy to test the purity level.

It does not go bad and can last for thousands of year or essentially forever.

It is easy enough to move and transport at the medieval to pre-modern age requirements.

It has limited quantity but available large enough across different geography.
 
The crave of this easy to believe in medium of exchange led to the Spanish colonization of the American continent, as well as the Gold Rush of the California Wild West. 
 
### The Invention of Paper money

Fiat or paper money was first used in China in the 7th century. 
 
Kublai Khan, the Mongolian emperor of China, founder of the Yuan Dynasty created the Jiaochao as the national currency, essentially created the first predominant circulating paper money system.
 
First time in history, the power to control the monetary system or the medium of exchange is fully controlled by the state. 
 
However, paper money with its unlimited potential quantity as well as lighter weight fostered commerce across the Yuan Dynasty as well as future Mongo vast empire from Europe to Asia. 

### The Gold Standard Come In and Out of Fiat Currency System
 
Initially, paper money was not backed by gold but backed by milliary power. After conquering China in 13 century,  Kublai Khan established the paper money credibility by confiscating all gold and silver and forced all traders to accept his paper money or being executed. 
 
However, the forceful introduction of paper money did not gain popularity everywhere. It led to the collapse of trade in Persia during 1294 and only lasted for around 300 years in China and then disappeared after 15 century.
 
In 1661, The Kingdom of Sweden issued the first paper money in the West but this fiat currency was also a failure because of the rapid inflation it causing and only lasted until 1776 and they have to return back to the commodity currency of gold and silver.
 
In 1821, the United Kingdom adopted a fiat currency system backed by Gold and for the first time we have a monetary system that achieves both the easy to transact strength of fiat currency as well as the stability value unit of gold.
 
Other Western powers gradually adopted gold-backed fiat currency with Germany in 1871, Sweden in 1873, the United States in 1873 and France in 1874.
 
To put the monetary system into afterburner mode, Britain temporary abandoned the gold-backed fiat monetary system to fund its World War I and World War II effort and other countries gradually got off the gold standard following Britain.
 
After World World II, the United States emerged as the major winner with its massive industrial and military strength as well as limited damage to its critical infrastructure. With the Bretton Woods international monetary agreement of 1944,  every currency fixed their exchange rate to US Dollars. 

The world switched from Gold-backed currencies to US-dollar backed currencies.

### US Dollar as the World Reserve Currency

So does everyone believe in US Dollar after Bretton Woods ? Not really.

By early summer 1944, World War II has decisively turned against Germany
After the successful Crimean Offensive by the Soviet from April 8 to May 12, 1944, the outcome of World War II has been decided.

German has been pushed back everywhere across Eastern front and the Soviet Forces were racing toward Berlin.

Finally, Britain and US forces entered WWII with the D-Day landing at Normandy, France on June 6, 1944 during Operation Overlord. 

Less than a month later on July 1, Allied nations met at the The Bretton Woods conference to draw out a reconstruction plan. The result was the creation of two today modern organizations: the IMF and the World Bank.

The original agreement was that the US Dollar would be pegged to Gold at $35 per Troy ounces and every other countries’ currency would be pegged to US Dollars with the IMF as the organization to keep the exchange rate stable.

Also all World Bank reconstruction loans would be in US Dollars.

Following the Bretton Woods agreement, the world rapidly recovered from World War II with most Western industrialized nations reached their pre-war GDP by 1960s. We already experienced a very stable financial system with very few banking crises during the Bretton Woods era. 

Bretton Woods system last from the 1940s - 1970s. 

The Great Society Programs by Johnson and the rise of US military spending in Vietnam led to the excessive amount of US dollars in circulation and US dollar value against gold was quickly declining. 

The United States did not have the money to keep buying more gold to peg keep the conversion rate of the US Dollar per Troy ounces gold at 35$. 

OPEC readjusted the oil price to gold instead of the US dollars to adjust to the additional US dollars being flood into the market which is the true reason behind the oil shock of 1973. 

The European Union was also later then created in response to the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement with the EURO as the region new currency. 

After the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement under Richard Nixon, we are having a free-float currency exchange system, a perpetual entropy of the global financial market. 

Some countries choose to let the market mechanism deciding their currencies exchange rate.  Other countries with large inflow and outflow of foreign investment keep their currency exchange rate stable to keep domestic inflation in check and foster trading with other nations.
