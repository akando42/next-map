### The Race of Genes Mutation to a Superior Energy Conversion Formula

Some form of super strong space magnetic force, large space asteroids or earth core explosions caused the South American and Australian plates to first collide with the African continent and then bounce off back to its original position which killed off most of the apex predators of earth because of extreme climate fluctuation.

While the dinosaurs with its lack of ability to regulate its body temperature and use its energy efficiently died off during the extreme climate fluctuation period, the mammal branch with its ability to regulate the body temperature via its blood circulation system and its ability to digest food and use that energy efficiently evolved quickly in the new harsh environment. Millions of years after the massive tectonic shift, the earth climate fluctuation milded down and all the dinosaurs died off, the mammal branch with its countless mutations gradually became the apex predator of the new earth environment.

Most of the mammal branch variants, quite similar to other animal branches, are still using their teeths and jaw chewing and biting as the first step in energy capturing and processing, primates were the first one to start using both their jaw and their hands to capture and process energy sources. With just this new energy processing habit, primates became fews among the mammal branch that can peal off the protective layers of their food sources with their hand instead of their jaw.

While using less of their jaw for processing energy, primates jaw started to reduce in size which allowed a lighter head and lower the central of gravity. Standing up and walking around became increasing easier and more stable with a lighter head and lower central of gravity. However, the ability to stand up right did not become essential for primates outside of Africa since there are plenty of water and food in other regions. 

![Techtonic Plate and Mountion of Africa](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/New%20Technonic%20Plate%20of%20Africa.png)

The collision and split up between African continent and South America and Australia plates formed the mountain formation both in the East and West of African continent. These mountains formation blocked and limited rainny clouds to be able to reach deep inside the African continential shells which results in Savana like climates with fews lakes, rivers or vegetation food sources.

The African Savana primates need to be able travel much further than primates in other regions of the earth to find food and water. Walking upright on two legs became essential for the ability to find foods efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. After many generation of African Savana primate adaptations, the African Savana primate developed several mutations to be able walk up right efficiently.

The connecting point between the head of Neanderthal, Denisovan and Homo Sapien and their neck bone are both at the central of the head instead of the back of their head like in four legs mammals which allows these human variances to stand up and keep their balance easily with central gravity of the head and the entire body staying at the same vertical line.

Position of the big toe in upright human variances also adapted to enable balance standing and walking in order reduce energy consumption while traveling to find food and water. These upright human variances were spending most their time on the ground instead of climbing trees so they no longer need the grabbing bone structures in the foot like we would find quite common in the tree climbing primates.

The lack of rain and vegetation in Savana climate also forced the early human to start hunting other animals instead just capturing stationary energy sources like fruits and vegetation like our tree-climbing primate cousins. Once again, the feet bone structure mutated to allow not just standing and walking but also running and jumping. The modern Homo Sapien feet would develop an arc-like shape to allow the feet to absorb the shock while running and jumping.

### Ancient Georgia - The River Fork of Early Human Gene Flow and Religions.

More than 2.6 Million years ago, the early human Homo Sapiens took a leap of faith and ventured outside of their comfortable environment in the African savanna. The origin of Jewish, Muslism and Christianity is probably the metaphorical result from folktale stories passing by thoundstand of generations about the migration flow of early humans from Africa through the areas of modern Egypt, Israel, Caucasus, Turkey, Iran and Iraq to the rest of the world. The word Caucasian was first used by German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach refer to as a reference to the “white” race. However, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach classification of five human races have very little to do with skin color but more to do with the shape of a human skull.

![Five Human Races](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Blumenbach%27s_five_races.JPG/1024px-Blumenbach%27s_five_races.JPG)

The Caucasian according to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach are people of  European, Middle Eastern, and North African origin. However, in the United States, the original scientific word, Caucasian, was used very differently referring primarily to descendants of European immigrants and have a tendency to be related to the features of blue eyes, blonde hair and light skin. Nevertheless, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach is the godfather of the word “Caucasian” as well as modern anthropology. 

Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia maybe because one of them were the Homo Sapien and the other was Neanderthal. God later curses the serpent and the ground because Adam and Eva ate the forbbiden Apple of knowledge maybe because two biggest human fear are being lied to and being death.

Modern genetical data as well as the latest research finding would classify human into 3 different genetic groups: Homo Sapiens gene majority ( African savanna), Homo Sapiens with Neanderthal in the Caucus mixing (1-4%), Homo Sapiens with Denisovan in Southeast Asia mixing (4-6%). The question of who we are is extremely political sensitive and could be used along with religions to promote dangerous political agendas. Our genetics data is still very limited to provide a statistical significant and definite answer.
