### Ancient Georgia - The River Fork of Early Human Gene Flow and Religions.
<br>

More than 2.6 Million years ago, the early human Homo Sapiens took a leap of faith and ventured outside of their comfortable environment in the African savanna.

The origin of Jewish, Muslism and Christianity is probably the metaphorical result from folktale stories passing by thoundstand of generations about the migration flow of early humans from Africa through the areas of modern Egypt, Israel, Caucasus, Turkey, Iran and Iraq to the rest of the world.

The word Caucasian was first used by German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach refer to as a reference to the “white” race. However, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach classification of five human races have very little to do with skin color but more to do with the shape of a human skull.

The Caucasian according to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach are people of  European, Middle Eastern, and North African origin.

However, in the United States, the original scientific word, Caucasian, was used very differently referring primarily to descendants of European immigrants and have a tendency to be related to the features of blue eyes, blonde hair and light skin. 

Nevertheless, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach is the godfather of the word “Caucasian” as well as modern anthropology. 

Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia maybe because one of them were the Homo Sapien and the other was Neanderthal.

God later curses the serpent and the ground because Adam and Eva ate the forbbiden Apple of knowledge maybe because two biggest human fear are being lied to and being death.

Modern genetical data as well as the latest research finding would classify human into 3 different genetic groups:
<br>
<br>
Homo Sapiens gene majority ( African savanna) <br>
Homo Sapiens with Neanderthal in the Caucus mixing (1-4%) <br>
Homo Sapiens with Denisovan in Southeast Asia mixing (4-6%) <br>

The question of who we are is extremely political sensitive and could be used along with religions to promote dangerous political agendas. Our genetics data is still very limited to provide a statistical significant and definite answer.
