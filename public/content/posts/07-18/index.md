The status quo only could only be changed via the act of creation or deletion. Mein Kampf or KiloMeters or Military Killer was written while Adolf Hitler was imprisoned near city of Munich, Bavaria province, Germany. The book was Hitler's solution to personal struggles as well as German society hardships after WWI during a period of hyperinflation and economic depression.

Human civilizations have always been developing around major rivers. The rivers provide navigable passage at low energy cost per pound of transported goods in comparison with other modes of transportation. Till this day, with the invention of trains, cars, planes, etc.. navigating by floating and gliding on top of the thing that makes earth unique from any other planets, water, is still the most cost-effective way. The only potential more cost-effective way to move goods is via zero-gravity space orbit.

This innate gift from nature, a broad extensive network of 7 rivers have allowed Germany to flourish with large farmland area to feed its massive population as well as trading with surrounding countries via river shipping. This river network allows Germany merchants to have a direct, cheap and efficient way to transfer their goods to other major European’s commerce hubs as well as reaching the high seas.  

However, with this innate gift from nature, a large river network and limited direct route without going through another country’ ocean chokepoints,  Germany has always de-prioritize the need to develop a large ocean-faring commercial and military ships that proved to be a fatal flaw to its development later on in 20 century. 

The fertile open plane that is great for agriculture also proved to be an easy access path for ground invasion forces from France during the Napoleon era and WWI as well as Russia during WWII. What if Adolf Hilter was never born, would Germany start World War Two? My bet is that they would start the war sooner or later with another German leader. Adolf Hilter and his book Mein Kampf was able to offer a solution, a very cruel one, to a discontent masses in Germany at the time. 

Mein Kampf can be translated into English as “My Struggle” or “My Fight”. Hitler wrote part one of Mein Kampf during his imprisonment at The Barvarian Fortress following a failed Munich Putsch’s coup attempt in 1923. The book paints a detailed picture of Hitler’s early life, outline his world-view and plans for Germany’s future. To understand a dark world view in his book, one has to learn about Hitler's past life events as well as the German society sentiment leading to book publication. 

Hitler’s father was a civil servant who wanted Hitler to follow in his footsteps into the public services career. Hitler declined this guidance during his childhood but definitely, his father did plant a seed for him to get into the political sphere later in life. Hitler as a kid was a gifted orator and had a generally pleasant childhood growing up in a middle class well off family.Big life events started to dim the light of his world view as a pass-away of his father when he was 14 and mother in 1907 when he was 18. 

These tragic events forced Hitler to stop pursuing his dream of becoming an artist and taking up general labor to take care of himself as a teenager.Mein Kampf was written by Hitler under tremendous emotional stress from his imprisonment as well as the contentious historical events in Germany at the time. 

Early 1923, the French invaded disarmed Germany in an attempt to annex Ruhr and Rhineland from Germany. Several other separatist movements were also happening across Germany. The complete dismemberment of Germany as a united country was at the point of becoming a completed fact. Hitler mobilized his storm battalions in Bavaria in favor of national union but when they reached the city central square, the Army opened fire on the demonstrators. 16 marchers were instantly killed, several were wounded. Hitler was then arrested and imprisoned for 13 months. During this period he wrote the first part of Mein Kampf.

During and after World War I, many European governments over-extended their monetary power to fund war ambitions by switching in and out of the Gold Standard. This was causing European economies to experience extreme deflation and inflation that end up causing the massive European banking crisis and The Great Depression in the 1930s.

The German & Austrian people suffering humiliation after the lost WWI, hyperinflation and huge food shortage were looking for an explanation of their suffering. This populous wave of discontent propelled Mein Kampf to Germany bestsellers as well as catalyze Hitler’s dark worldview and his rise to power. Before becoming Chancellor in 1933, Hitler has sold 240,000 copies of Mein Kampf and made over 1.2 million Reichsmarks or around 5 million USD. The book initially served as a bibble for National Socialism followers but later on was made popular in general German public.
