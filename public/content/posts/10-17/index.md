David Sun[^fn1] and John Tu, two Kingston Technology founders consistently rank as richest Asian Americans in tech. 

They currently take number 119 in the Forbes top 400 Highest Net Worth Americans. 

Well there are a lot of Asian American in tech and Asian household average income top all ethnicities in America above 90,000 / year[^fn2]. Why our number one can even make the top 100. 

Maybe White Supremacy is the invisible glass ceiling in America keeping us at the milkcow status in this country.

Maybe capable Asian tech entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers and scientists would be better off in Asia than in America in the 21st century.

 
# Journeys of the mtDNA Haplogroup M

### Haplogroup M1 and The Back to Africa Journey

5100 BC, during a Westward expansion, the people of Asia belonging to mtDNA Haplogroup M1 traveled back to North Africa[^fn3] through the Euroasia area and created the Ancient Egyptian empire. 

They archirected the Egyptian pyramids of Giza and constructed them with the help of local North Africa population. 

Recently discovery of 21,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia[^fn4], Southeast Asia might explain the mysterious lost civilization of MU or Atlantis as well as the Pyramid architecture in Ancient Egypt and Ancient Inca. 

Modern DNA test has confirmed results that Khnum-nakht and Nekht-ankh, the two famous Egyptian pharaohs in the Manchester Museum at the University of Manchester, UK belong to the the M1A1 mtDNA haplogroup[^fn5].

It is also deeply intriguing that Adolf Hitler’s DNA result [^fn6] showing that he has a Jewish & North Africa ancestor. 

Before World War II, Hitler and the Nazi Germany’s extensive researchs of the Pyramids of Giza may explain the anti-Sematic policies of Hitler and his hatred toward Jewish people as well as the Swatika’s Indian Jainism religion origin. 

Maybe after all the genocides by Western collonial powers in South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia, karma just return right back. Hilter and Nazi rise indirectly led to the collapse of collonialism and started the independence movement across all formal collonies. 

Maybe when it got really dark, the sunrise is just a few hours away.

### Long Sailing Journey to Easter Island of Haplogroup M7

M7 MtDNA Haplogroup originated from Southeast Asia and spread North to South Siberia and East to Easter Island and South America. 

Modern day mtDna M7 individuals can be found in high concentration in Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philiphine, Altan people near Altai mountain and Polynesians population in the Pacific Ocean[^fn7].

Maybe our ancestors, the Aquatic ape descendants, were very adventurous people, great at swimming, fishing, sailing and want to keep sailing East, where the Sun raise, to have the chance to meet the Golden Sun god. So they started their journey from Mandalay, Myanmar where Rambo 4 was filmed to Easter Island, Chile.  

These sailors are aquatic warriors and buddhist monks with their long and big monkey ears and shaved head. They started their journey to the East on big sailed wooden boats. The story of the lost MU civilization from their ancestors is another reason to start the risky but uplifting journey.  

Keep following the island chains of Indonesia through Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fijis, American Samoa, French Polynesia, Pitcairn Islands and finally Easter Islands.

When they made it to Easter Island, they run out of all foods, supplies as well as crew members. Most of the ships sunk on the journeys. 

They sent out scout ships to East, North, South and just found blue water and eternal sky. So they settled in the Easter Island. They charmed local population of Easter Island into helping with the reconstruction of huge wooden ships for their journey home. 

They also built massive stone figures resembling themselves as a way to mark their spots in history and tell a thousand year story about their journey to meet the Golden Sun god. These stone human figures, Moai, was used as anchors to ropes that secures their newly built ships as well as gifts to the sea gods for a safe journey ahead. 

The building of settlements as well as reconstructions of ocean-faring ships probably took up to 1-2 generations and led to the total deforestation of Easter Island.

These sailors architectured[^fn8] a system of canals around the island to transport large carved stone figures floating on wooden platform around the island. The finishing touch of these Moai was probably done underwater for the ease of rotating and moving the stone block around.

These secret underwater construction and transportation method was probably used to build the Egyptian pyramids as well as Inca pyramids and maybe why Germany U-Boats was so good[^fn9].

However, 7 of the monks with their sense of adventure and divine absolute conviction chose to risk it all sailing to the end of the world instead of making a long journey home with everyone. They finally made it to South America. 

In the Inca Myths,  four Ayar aka Asia brothers with divine powers came out from the caves inside of a hill in the area of Pacaritambo.

Unfortunately, the mummies and bodily remains of the Inca emperors, worshiped as gods, were burnt and buried in unknown locations due to religious and political persecution by the Christian conquistadors and inquisitors, so there exists no direct material for DNA analysis

However, DNA data analysis of modern South American founded a rare present Haplogroup C-B477 which is popular among Indigenous Australians, Papuan people, Melanesian people and Polynesian people. C-B477 was probably more widely found before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors and their Influenza diseases. 

# Rigel and Betelgeuse, Good and Evil, Yin and Yang

Ten-gr-ism was the prevailing religion of the Turks, Mongols, Hungarians, Bulgars and Huns and widely advocated among intellectual circles.
 
The mongols pray to the “Munkh Khukh Tengri” or Eternal Blue Sky. How did they know the sky is eternal more than 700 years ago ?
 
Religion should be promoted as a way of life to inspire the best qualities among men and women, not as a super powerful almighty figure that all common people should be afraid of. 
 
When dealing with the hardest moment in life, we need religion to help to take foolish steps to achieve the impossible. Like Steve Job once said: 
 
You can’t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards.

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
 
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow
your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path. 
 
Latin will not be the most common alphabet without foolish senses of adventure and divine internal conviction by the Christian missionaries. The European sailors probably did not conquer the American continent, subdued the Vikings and their pageant god as well as colonize India and Asia without their Christian belief system. 
 
Mongol probably won't ride their horses tirelessly for more than three hundred years all four corners of the earth to reach the end of the world where the eternal blue sky meets the horizon. Maybe the mongol figured that out so they pick “the eternal sky” to inspire Mongol son and daughters of the Eternal Blue Sky to go explore and conquer all four corner of the earth.
 
And maybe the Hun and Mongol horses left so much trauma in the West that the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse got into the Bible as an early sign of bad luck.
 
Orion’s Constellation inspired the Egyptian to build their three massive pyramids, the Chinese to create the Yin and Yang’s sign and Constantine The Great to create his unique Christian symbol
from his vision before the battle of Milvian Bridge. 
 
Or maybe the stars actually affect our future and being at the right time at the right place can mean the stars radiation will trigger a change in our DNA that tips the balance of power in global scale. 

# The 21 Century, Clash of Civilizations

### England and Their Last Attempt at Greatness

England was number one economy in the world before World War II with an extensive network of colonies like the British once proclaimed 

“The sun never sets on the British Empire”

After World War II, England is once again a tiny island and in the decline. 

By 2016, Europe is in turmoil and England only advantage left in the global economy is the popularity of its language and its close alliance with the United States.

Like during WWII, England hardliner brokered an alliance with the United States hardliner to place Donald meaning Ruler of the World in Scotish English as president of the United States and blames it on Russia - a typical MI6 Fall Flag operation, preparing American public as well as England for major war with the rising China and other East Asian nations.

Samuel Huntingon describes American identity as not “a Nation of Immigrants” but “a Nation of British settlers” and these first Bristish settlers or the 13 collonies create the American Creed as embodying the “principles of liberty, equality, individualism, representative government and private property” for White people.

Well he also believes America is a country of White Briitish Protestian Christian and concerned about the Latino Immigrants, their Spanish language and their Roman Christian Catholics would divide America in half as a society.

Samuel Huntington believe Latino immigrants need to learn English and convert to Protestian Christian.  

Samuel Huntington predicted a major “Clash of Civilizations” between the United States and Islam since both religions are:

- Missionary religions, seeking to convert others.
- Universal, all or nothing. Believe their god is only correct one. 
- Teleological ⇒ Placing their entire human existence on their Christian values and beliefs.

Whether it is self-fulfilled prophecy or good prediction, it did happen with 9/11, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and then Syrian war. 

In Clash of Civilization, he also predicted the rise of China and their attempt to reassert their hegemony in East Asia and the Western Pacifics. If his prediction is true again this time then Asia will become the new Middle East in the next decade.

And China and Southeast Asia nations would band together like the former Warsaw pact to warn off British and American involvement or it could become the new Middle East and China would get broken up like Yugoslovakia and re-experienced its century of humiliation. 

### Russia and The New NATO Plus

During Bill Clinton’s visit to Moscow in 2000, Vladimir Putin discussed the possibility of
Russia to join NATO, to which Clinton responded that he did not mind. 

With recent British withdrawal from the EU and American reducing financial support for NATO countries, maybe it is the right time to discuss potential NATO membership again with Russia. 

Russia NATO membership means EU countries actually can reduce military spending
since the Russia threat now is off the table. 

If NATO membership is not an option, Russia can always try to get support from Norway, Sweden, Finland and Turkey to form a military alliance called the Scorpion since Scandinavian countries are generally neutral and probably tired of American financial recklessness and total dominance of world affairs. Deep down inside, Sandinavian nations and Russia are used to be all part of the Viking family anyway and it is time for a Family Union. 

Norway constitution is the oldest standing constitution in the world and could possibly be the best one. Scandinavian nations are Socialists so they could be more acceptant to Russia’s past Bolshevik revolution records. Scandinavian countries and Russia supplies energy to the rest of the EU, so it makes sense that they have the big say at the table. 


### Southeast Asia and The End of Aircraft Carrier Age

Logistics is essential in war from the ancient time of Roman Empire and the Mongol to the Carriers battle of the Pacifics during WWII as well as future 21 century warfare.

The Mongol and British Royal Navy was so potent because of their unfair logistics advantage or Warren Buffet's term, an economic moat. 

The Mongol can live off their conquered land or even live off their horse with their milk and salts while the British Blue Water Royal Navy can conduct long-term blockcades and sieges from their ships. 

A nuclear aircraft carrier in theories can run indefinitely for years. However, how useful is an empty aircraft carrier with no ammunitions, jet fuel or food and supplies for their sailors.

With tremendous advantage since the Cold War of missile technology, every advanced nation now possess high-resolution low orbit satellites and long-range missiles as well as anti-ship missiles that can be launched from land platforms as well as destroyers and battle cruisers.

With an increasing American debt level with no ending in sight as well as bridge-burner president at the top, America mostly likely will first lose their bases in Thailand, Philipine, Korea and Japan and then in Europe.

America needs its global network of military bases to provide an essential logistics advantage in case of major war. A carrier battle group with no foreign bases will just be empty ships that run forever like the Flying Dutchman.

The future ocean will be dominated by supersonic attack submarines, submarine drone carriers, low flying reconnaissance and attack satellites.

During WWII, Japan captured the first triangle: Hanoi, Mandalay and Bangkok and Germany was so close at capturing the second triangle Berlin, Istanbul and Moscow but fail.During the Cold War, Soviet Union have control over East Berlin and Moscow but block by American missile base in Turkey.

Maybe finally in 21 century, two golden triangles could finally be unlocked either through military or diplomacy and economic alliances to finally return EuroAsia to its rightful place as the driver of world history.
