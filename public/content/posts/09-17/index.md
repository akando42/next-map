## What is a Constitution ?

A body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed.

A good constitution design should be derived from a deep understanding of the cultural and biological characteristics of its governed people as well as the geographical characteristics of the surrounding geography. 

At the time of the US Constitution signed on September 17, 1787, United States founders might have take into consideration these 3 metrics:

- Cultural characteristics.
- Biological characteristics.
- Geographical characteristics. 

Of Early American settlers to design and write the US Constitution. 

At the time of the written Constitution, US population was around 4 millions people living in 16 States at the North Eastern and Southern Regions of modern America.  

According to the 1790 Census, among these 4 millions people:

- 807,095 FREE White Males of 16 years of upward  Eligible to Vote 
- 791,850 FREE White Under 16.
- 1,541,263 FREE White Female
- 59,150 other FREE person
- 694,280 Slavs.

Early American settlers are mainly European immigrants, mostly Caucasian.

They come from different corners of Europe with different languages, cultures but mainly part of the Christian Western Civilization.

So without a doubt, the US Constitution was designed to optimize for the benefits of FREE White Males who are no longer subjects of the European Kings. 

However, a great American Constitution innovation that later copied by other European nations as well as the rest of the world is its division of powers among the three branches of government, working like a holy seal that forever preventing the return of the king and his tyranny.
