Moon has formed 4.51 billion years ago after a giant impact between Earth and a mars-sized body called Theia, an Earth Trojan. Earth Trojans are asteroids that orbit the Sun in the same or within the vicinity orbit of Earth. Earth large core in relation to its volume is the result of Theia and Gaia ( the early Earth) combination after the collision.

The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth every 29.53 days. The moon always shows the same face to Earth because of its orbits Earth and rotates around itself the exact amount of times

This is why in the old world, the lunar or Moon calendar is still widely used.

Easter in Christianity is the first Sunday after the 1st full moon in the Lunar calendar. 

Ramadan in Islamic is one day after the 9th new Moon in the lunar calendar. 

Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Mongolian New Year is the 1st day of the 1st month is the moon calendar. 

Vesak or Buddha's Birthday is the first full moon in the second month of the lunar year. 

Rosh Hashanah, the Hebrew new year, is the birthday of the universe, the first sight of new Moon in the Hebrew calendar. So supposedly the same date as the Ramanda. 
However, the Hebrew calendar adds 13 months every 3 years into its calendar. 
So every 33 years. Romanda in Islamic and Rosh Hashanah in Hebrew start on the same date. 

So fuck yes, Moon is a big deal in every culture cause we saw it every night when we have too much free time so we can look up into the sky. Also, Moon is more pleasant to the human’s eyes.

In many cultures, the 1st day of Lunar New Year is believed to be the birthday of the universe. It makes more sense that 1st day of Lunar New Year is the new Earth birthday.

So we have been dreaming about getting to the moon since forever. And Neil Amstrong makes that happen July 21, 1969, when he becomes the first man walking on the moon during Apollo 11. 

So let's look into Neil Amstrong biography to see what it takes to become an astronaut and walk on the Moon. 

The dude was born Aug 5, 1930, in Ohio. His father was an auditor and the family moves around a lot in his childhood.  They live in 16 different towns in Ohio. 

When he was a tiny 2-year-old, his father took him to Cleveland Air race. Well we form most of our 1st memory at 2 so that was it, Neil is destined to become a pilot. 

At 17, Neil got accepted to the  Aeronautical Engineering at Purdue University. He also got accepted to MIT but MIT football team sucks so Purdue it is. 

Neil went to school for free. Tuition was paid for under Holloway plan, a Navy program to fund education for Navy officers outside of the Naval Academy. 

Yeah, but the tuition money does come with string. After 2 years at Purdue, in 1949 Neil got called to the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for Flight Training, receive his first Aircraft Carrier training in 1950 and flight his first Korean Action in August 1951

Sep 3, 1951, 5 days after starting his Korean mission, his Aircraft was down but he ejected safely. Following the accident, Neil flight another 78 missions in Korea without a hitch.

1952, his regular commission was terminated and Neil returns to the US for his education at Purdue. 

Neil Amstrong was an OK student, received 4.8/8 upon graduation at Pursue maybe because of his Phi Delta fraternity membership. 

Neil continues his education at the University of Southern California and got his master degree in  Aerospace Engineering from USC. 

Upon finishing his education, he applied to become an experimental research test pilot 
at Lewis Flight Propulsion Lab where he had a lot of fun.

Neil got to fly many different exotic aircraft:
Boeing B-29 Superfortress 
F-100 Super Sabre
McDonnell F101 Voodoo
Lockheed F-104 Starfighter
Republic F-105 Thunderchief
Convair F-106 Delta Dart
Douglas DC-3
Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star
North American F-86 Sabre
McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II
Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer
Boeing B-47 Stratojet
Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker
X-15-1

April 1962, NASA announced Project Gemini, Neil applied to the program 1 week late after the deadline but got accepted anyway. 

His first space mission was Gemini 8 and after the mission, Neil became the highest paying Astronaut. Before Apollo 11, Neil was also a crew member in Gemini 11, Apollo 8.

Neil Amstrong is the commander of the Apollo 11 mission. And during this mission, he made the famous First Moon Walk:

He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969 then spoke the now-famous word, 

That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

There are  12 members of the Apollo 11 mission who walked on the moon. So who is going to be the thirteenth man walking on the moon? Most likely a Chinese Astronaut.

So it’s an unlucky thing. Maybe for some people but not for others. Zeus was the thirteenth and the most powerful God of the Greek mythology

13th day of any month is an extremely auspicious day according to Hinduism. This day is dedicated to Lord Shiva, the destroyer. 13th is considered one of the most fruitful days of the month according to Hindu beliefs.

The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program started in 2003. 
October 24, 2007, the Chang’e 1 make its first lunar orbiter
October 1 2010, the Chang’e 2 make its second lunar orbiter
Dec 1, 2013, the Chang’e 3 soft-land the moon
Dec 7, 2018, the Chang’e 4 soft-land on the far side of the moon

At this pace, China will land a man on the moon between 2021-2028. 

So space programs are just the nation’s poster child projects or it actually has commercial impacts.

Space satellites have been helping to map the entire planet, utilized in many military and commercial applications. 

The next application maybe space shipping ?

It cost 0.2 dollars per pound in fuel to reach orbit and back. The main cost in space travel is the hardware. 

With recent development in reusable rockets from SpaceX and Blue Origins, space shipping at some point will be FASTER and CHEAPER than freight ocean shipping.

Imagine, we will have a system of Suborbital transport Ship, Space Elevator and Orbital Warehouse that offers same-day shipping between New York and Shanghai. 

In a distant future, every country will be able to launch its ballistic FEDEX truck into orbit to drop off and pick up their favorite delivery.

Or even more interesting, what if all manufacturing is moving from China to the Moon. No more manufacturing pollution, we will just receive our goods via airdrops like the way Santa does during Christmas.

We will actually be tracking our packages via the NORAD’s system for real this time.
