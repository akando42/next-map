### Politics is Temporary, Genetics and Geography is Permanent
![EU](content/posts/02-21/eu.png)

What would you do if you can travel anywhere on earth within a week and possess personal arms advanced enough to deal with any potential threats on your journey with little risk of death and injuries to your crews. At the beginning of 1900, the Western world already mastered ocean fairing and air travel with the inventions of the combustion engines.

Since humans are land animals with advanced organization skills, if a crew from Europe traveled on land into a highly populated area of a foreign tribe, they would risk triggering a hostile response from the local tribes when the tribes suddenly met a group of strangely looking foreigners. Even with modern guns, if they are outnumbered or caught in an ambush, there is nothing to ensure their safety. 

However with planes and the iron ships, the European power can keep a distance, maneuver and take advantage of their saturating fire power. 

Probably after finishing the drawing of the World Map and collecting terrains and population data of the earth civilization with combustion engine powered planes,ocean vessels and cars, the West realized how outnumbered but more advanced they are to the other civilizations around the globe.

By moving core leadership components behind nature barriers like mountains and ocean, the more advanced civilizations of the West can rely on their air powers and sea powers to deal with the hordes of land-based East Asian and Indian civilization ambitions. And after completing the colonization of North America and migrating VIP European lineages to the uncrossable via land castle of North America by 1900, the Western civilization can start to switch from defensive plans to offensive plans by transforming the genetic makeup of Euro Asia. 

Before WW1 and WW2, most of the earth surfaces were still empty with no major road networks or borders. By deporting and reshuffling tribes and kingdoms of people from the Caucasus to Central Asia as well as from China and Korea to Vietnam, European colonial powers can redraw the chessboard of earth surfaces to put enemy tribes into conflicts and friendly tribes behind major geographical anchors like in the case of Kazahstan and Japan.

Why it is very difficult to find the Great Walls of China from satelite images, we can easily spot the mountain ranges of Western China near Chengdu and Xian.

Why Japan was the first country in East Asia to modernize their military and society ? Probably because they were open-minded people who were willing to listen to the strange ideas of the Portugese sailors and tried out the strange modern guns of the British navy. Or maybe because the Western colonial powers have picked Japan because of their resemblance to England - the Engineering island of the West. By arming Japan and mechanizing Japanese industries and militaries, Japan will serve as the prison guards of mainland China.

Did Pearl Harbor ever happen for real or just a movie set like in the case of the present Ukrainian war between Ukraine and Russia. After the Pearl Harbor, the bloody date between Japanese soldiers and the Chinese men and women did result in famine and the victory of Chinese RED army supported by the once enemy of China, the Soviet Union.

![Pearl Harbor](content/posts/02-21/pearl_harbor.png)

After China was fully submitted to Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union and Japan surrendered to the United States, all citizens of the most populous empire in the world, the Qing dynasty, had been boxed in from all 3 directions North by Russia, West by Kazahstan and East by Japan and South Korea. The only way out is to go South to South East Asia. By moving Chinese lineages South every 10 years via staged military campagins and inserting new genetics lineages from Chengdu, the West can make the modern Chinese looking increasing more like them just like the Christian god mission of creating men after his own image. Hence there are major military operations every 10 year since 1950 after China Civil War concluded with 1st Gen in 1968, 2nd in Gen 1978, 3 in Gen 1988, 4th Gen in 1998, 5th in Gen 2008, 6th Gen in 2018. We will probably see major wars or pandemics again in 2028-2030.
