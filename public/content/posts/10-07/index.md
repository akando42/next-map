#Russia is the largest country in the world, possess most number of nuclear warheads and at somepoint control most number of people in the world via its #Soviet system. How a small population of less than 2% of world population can sway so much of the world destiny. 

### Novogrod, Saint Petersburg and the Nordic Influences in Russia

A saint is simply an ordinary Christian who lead an extraordinary life and left behind a massive legacy for future generations of Christian. 

The word “Slav” comes from the latin word “Slave” since majority of slavic people were former slaves of Roman Empire. Peter the Great is an exemplar Christian for the Slavic people. He is the emperor that put Russia Empire on the map as a major European power, leaving behind a 2nd class European formal slave image. 

Kiev, Ukraine was the first capital of the Russian Empire. After experiencing a period of Mongol rule, a tax collector status for the Mongol help to propel Moscow to a more important role and eventually the major capital of Russian Empire. 

Mongol was a relative liberal ruler, just want to be able to collect taxes and appoint Russian crown prince. Mongol rule actually accidentally helped to shield Russian from being absorbed into the German Empire.  

Maybe because of this period, Slavic and Asian people have certain mutual respect and common suspicion for Western European powers.

Russian language is based on the Cryillic script which is being used as national script in various Slavic, Turkic and Persian-speaking countries. 

Two missionary brothers from Eastern Roman Empire: Saints Cyril and Methodius created the Glagolitic letters to able to translate the Bible into Slavic sounds for Slavic speaking people. 

A Bulgarian emperor understood that a ruler can use war to protect or expand a nation’s territorials but he needs culture to stabilize and solidify an enduring nation. So he ordered students of Saints Cyril and Methodius to create the Cyrilic alphabet from Greek and Glagolitic letters  to unite different Slavic tribes under a single nation. This is why Russian alphabet is closer to Greek alphabet than Latin alphabet.

As of 2019, 250 million people ( almost equal to the size of the United States) is using Cyralic alphabets. 

Soviet Union has the land, the people and the ports and it was the second largest economy in the world until the opening of second money printing facility in Fort Worth in 1987 and the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990. 

The biggest problem for Russia after the collapse of Soviet Union is its declining population and loss of important sea ports. Maybe Peter the Great’s city is the answer.

### Evolution from Kievan Rus to Moscow Russia
![The Genetics Influence of Russia](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/genetics_influences_of_russia.png)

#Russia and #Ukraine have the largest arable land in Europe and they were and still are major producers of farming products to the Western European market but do not have a long history of developing complex social and military structures.

#Serf-dom or #Slav-dom is a farmer social class who are not allowed to move around but stay year around at the farm to work on it, have to pay a large percentage of their farming output to the kings and nobles who control the land, horses and major water sources via the use of forces. 

#Slav-dom was the largest social class in Eastern Europe until the 19th century because of Russia's large arable land area. 

Before mechanization, without the farmers, there would be no one to work on the farms and the #Russian kings and nobles would have no income or valuable goods to trade for furs and other luxury items from #WesternEurope, #Scandinavia and the #BlackSea. 

The #Romanov dynasty, a #Roman-Tatar lineage, built the Moscow fortress faraway from two #EasternEuropean major rivers, the Dnieper and Volga in order to keep their slaves from running away as well as avoiding surprise raids from their enemies.

The #Moscow fortress was able to accumulate the most amount of #Slav farmers as well as keeping them safe from being killed by raids from the #Mongol in the East or #German in the West. 

With large area of farmland, most amount of farmers and no flood, #Moskova or много коровыp or #MostCows, developed a large fleet of cattles for meat and milk, expanded their population quickly and became the richest and strongest city state in #Russia. 

### From Vlad the Impaler Lineage First Stop to Vladivostok Final Stop
The European planners placed the most cruel lineages at the frontiers regions, first in Hungary Romania, then in Vladimir Moscow and then finally now in Vladivostok.
 

### Russia and Its Siberian Stockpile of Nuclear, Chemical and Biological WMD.
By poisoning the main water stream or storage with chemical weapons, one could achieve the force multiplier effects. A small group of dozen chemical weapon specialists could cause widespread damage to hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians within a population center that shares that water stream or storage. Hence harmful chemical compounds getting into the main water source would become a Weapon of Mass Destruction. 

The Russian planners were using Chemical weapons on the main Kazakh population water source, the Aral sea, as well as building Hydroelectric Dams in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to control water input of Kazakh tribes. The use of chemical weapons on water input eliminates population growth of Native Kazan while promoting Russian-Kazakh inter-marriage to eliminate any threats of invasion from these historical enemies.

By spreading viral disease inside high density population centers, military barracks with central air conditioners or major indoor transportation hubs like airports or train stations, a team of a dozen biological specialists could cause widespread sickness and death among millions of enemy combatants or civilians. 

COVID-19 is an example of Russian use of Biological WMD in China, European Union and United States. COVID-19 or COV-1 are version-1 and version-2 of the SARS virus stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or TSAR. While version 1 of SARS only spreaded to more than 8000 patients and caused 700 deaths, version 2 of SARS, COVID-19 spreaded to more than 695,000,000 patients and caused more than 6,920,000 deaths. The version 3 of SARS with a higher fatality rate could be more damaging than nuclear weapons but with high deniability of who actually launched the biological weapons. 

By using viral biological weapons on highly dense population centers of China and the United States as well as its high speed and highly connected transportation network of trains and planes, COVID-19 achieved the Intercontinental reach of Ballistic Missiles as well as the lethality of Nuclear explosions. 

And Russia and its stockpile of nuclear weapons in Siberia can always choose the large casualty option within minutes anywhere on earth of its nuclear ballistic missiles. 


### Soviet Propaganda with the Technology levers under Modern Russia

From studying and training cattle animals like cows, dogs, horses, the preachers of Christianity probably found the similarity in low level code between humans and these farm animals.

Stalin studied to become a religious preacher for the Orthodox church. However, he ended up becoming a Communist revolutionary alongside Lenin of the Catholic churches. 

Maybe both of them are religious preachers who ported human programming techniques from Christianity to Communism. 

Communism's use of Symbols, Large Statues, Large Preaching Hall with careful design for sound effects is very similar to the design of Christian symbols, large Christian statues and large Churches with rows of chairs to listen to the preacher for hours. 

Humans living in modern cities no longer work on their own farm but become the animals in the industrialist farms. 

The control of all audio and visual inputs as well as the reward sensory of pleasure and the punishment sensory of pain in modern packed apartments is much easier than in the large open farm lands.

With modern broadcasting technology, first through the radio and television radio wave and now through the internet, these preaching halls have expanded globally to smart phones and laptops with mobile screen usage can reach up to 9 hours a day

By carefully tuning all the recommendation algorithms in Google, Youtube, Spotify, Ubers, Airbnb, Amazon, We Work and others, the human programmers of the Soviet era now can remotely control the audio, visual, pain and pleasure input of humans across the continents via the speed of light fiber optic cable data link.
