#Russia is the largest country in the world, possess most number of nuclear warheads and at somepoint control most number of people in the world via its #Soviet system. How a small population of less than 2% of world population can sway so much of the world destiny. 

### Scandinavian influences in Kiev, St Petersburg and Russian identity

The Volga rivers and its connected rivers form a large trade route between the Baltic Sea of Scandinavian and the Caspian Sea of Central Asia. This river trade route allows the Nord Viking to explore, trade and form settlements along the river bank of the Volga river all the way to the Caspian sea. 

During this Middle Age for the first time, the NORD culture of the Scandinavia area came into contact with the Nomadic culture of Central Asian Kazakh tribes. The NORD VIking was able to build large settlements along the Volga trade route in modern day Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Astrakhan. 

![The VOLGA trade route](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/the_volga_trade_route.png)

Through intermixing between Nord tribes with the local Kazakh tribes, the NORDIC-KAZAKH culture and identity started to form and stay relatively constant until modern day with monuments, religious buildings and symbols showing high value for GOLD and the Blonde color like Western European culture but still have facial features distinctively different from German, French or British.

However, with the Mongol expansion from the East, these NORDIC settlements were pushed back from the bank of the Volga river to the settlement of KIEV along the Dniper river. The NORDIC and SLAVIC tribes of Ukraine and Poland started to intermixing in this period and form another distinctive culture of NORDIC-SLAVIC in Ukraine and Western Russia. 

These Mongol raids reached all the way to Romania and only stopped by the CARPATHIAN MOUNTAIN range and the most barbaric Roman lineage, Vlad the Impaler. The ROMAN planners placed the most cruel lineages at its frontier regions of Hungary and Romania. The raids and battles between the Mongol tribes and the Vlad kingdom was the first time that the Mongol came into contact with the Roman Empire and their satellite states. The danger of the Eastern nomadic horsemen became known among the Roman world and the Roman planners started to send these Vlad lineages and their most cruel military generals to settle among the Nordic-Russian cities in modern Ukraine and Western Russian regions. 

The Roman Vlad lineages started to build Roman-style fortified settlements called Vladimir at the middle point between the Dniper river and the Volga river and utilized the local Nordic-Slavic women as gifts to the Mongol princes to reduce the number of Mongol raids to the West as well as way to learn about the Mongol tactics and military structures. These foreign tribes of VLAD from ROMANIA later became the KINGs of RUSSIA under the ROMANOV dynasty. 

### From Vlad the Impaler Lineage First Stop to Vladivostok Final Stop
![The Genetics Influence of Russia](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/genetics_influences_of_russia.png)

#Russia and #Ukraine have the largest arable land in Europe and they were and still are major producers of farming products to the Western European market but do not have a long history of developing complex social and military structures.

#Serf-dom or #Slav-dom is a farmer social class who are not allowed to move around but stay year around at the farm to work on it, have to pay a large percentage of their farming output to the kings and nobles who control the land, horses and major water sources via the use of forces. 

#Slav-dom was the largest social class in Eastern Europe until the 19th century because of Russia's large arable land area. 

Before mechanization, without the farmers, there would be no one to work on the farms and the #Russian kings and nobles would have no income or valuable goods to trade for furs and other luxury items from #WesternEurope, #Scandinavia and the #BlackSea. 

The #Romanov dynasty, a #Roman-Tatar lineage, built the Moscow fortress faraway from two #EasternEuropean major rivers, the Dnieper and Volga in order to keep their slaves from running away as well as avoiding surprise raids from their enemies.

The #Moscow fortress was able to accumulate the most amount of #Slav farmers as well as keeping them safe from being killed by raids from the #Mongol in the East or #German in the West. 

With large area of farmland, most amount of farmers and no flood, #Moskova or много коровы or #MostCows, developed a large fleet of cattles for meat and milk, expanded their population quickly and became the richest and strongest city state in #Russia.
 

### Russia and Its Siberian Stockpile of Nuclear, Chemical and Biological WMD.
By poisoning the main water stream or storage with chemical weapons, one could achieve the force multiplier effects. A small group of dozen chemical weapon specialists could cause widespread damage to hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians within a population center that shares that water stream or storage. Hence harmful chemical compounds getting into the main water source would become a Weapon of Mass Destruction. 

![Chemical WMD](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/aral_sea_4x.gif)

The Russian planners were using Chemical weapons on the main Kazakh population water source, the Aral sea, as well as building Hydroelectric Dams in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to control water input of Kazakh tribes. The use of chemical weapons on water input eliminates population growth of Native Kazan while promoting Russian-Kazakh inter-marriage to eliminate any threats of invasion from these historical enemies.

By spreading viral disease inside high density population centers, military barracks with central air conditioners or major indoor transportation hubs like airports or train stations, a team of a dozen biological specialists could cause widespread sickness and death among millions of enemy combatants or civilians. 

COVID-19 is an example of Russian use of Biological WMD in China, European Union and United States. COV-1 and COVID-19 are version-1 and version-2 of the SARS virus standing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or TSAR. While version 1 of SARS only spreaded to more than 8000 patients and caused 700 deaths, version 2 of SARS, COVID-19 spreaded to more than 695,000,000 patients and caused more than 6,920,000 deaths. The version 3 of SARS with a higher fatality rate could be more damaging than nuclear weapons but with high deniability of who actually launched the biological weapons. 

By using viral biological weapons on highly dense population centers of China and the United States as well as its high speed and highly connected transportation network of trains and planes, COVID-19 achieved the Intercontinental reach of Ballistic Missiles as well as the lethality of Nuclear explosions. 

And Russia and its stockpile of nuclear weapons in Siberia can always choose the large casualty option within minutes anywhere on earth of its nuclear ballistic missiles. 


### Soviet Propaganda with the Technology levers under Modern Russia

From studying and training cattle animals like cows, dogs and horses, the preachers of Christianity probably found the similarity in low level code between humans and these farm animals. Stalin studied to become a religious preacher for the Orthodox church. However, he ended up becoming a Communist revolutionary alongside Lenin of the Catholic churches. Maybe both of them are religious preachers who ported human programming techniques from Christianity to Communism. 

![Conference vs Church](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/conferenceroom_vs_church.png)

Communism's use of Symbols, Large Statues, Large Preaching Hall with careful design for sound effects is very similar to the design of Christian symbols, large Christian statues and large Churches with rows of chairs to listen to the preacher for hours. Humans living in modern cities no longer work on their own farm but become the animals in the industrialist farms. 

The control of all audio and visual inputs as well as the reward sensory of pleasure and the punishment sensory of pain in modern packed apartments is much easier than in the large open farm lands. With modern broadcasting technology, first through the radio and television radio wave and now through the internet, these preaching halls have expanded globally to smart phones and laptops with mobile screen usage can reach up to 9 hours a day

By carefully tuning all the recommendation algorithms in Google, Youtube, Spotify, Ubers, Airbnb, Amazon, We Work and others, the human programmers of the Soviet era now can remotely control the audio, visual, pain and pleasure input of humans across the continents via the speed of light fiber optic cable data link.

LinuxOS running most web servers, Finland and Russia is still close under the table. Putin kept his son in Finland to make sure his political infighting in Russia will not threaten his son life. His daughter in Russia is probably not a biological daughter but a public influential daughter.
