#Russia is the largest country in the world, possess most number of nuclear warheads and at somepoint control most number of people in the world via its #Soviet system. How a small population of less than 2% of world population can sway so much of the world destiny. 

### Novogrod, Saint Petersburg and the Nordic Influences in Russia
![Putin Son and Daughter](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/putin_son_and_daughter.png)

A saint is simply an ordinary Christian who lead an extraordinary life and left behind a massive legacy for future generations of Christian. 

The word “Slav” comes from the latin word “Slave” since majority of slavic people were former slaves of Roman Empire. Peter the Great is an exemplar Christian for the Slavic people. He is the emperor that put Russia Empire on the map as a major European power, leaving behind a 2nd class European formal slave image. 

Kiev, Ukraine was the first capital of the Russian Empire. After experiencing a period of Mongol rule, a tax collector status for the Mongol help to propel Moscow to a more important role and eventually the major capital of Russian Empire. 

Mongol was a relative liberal ruler, just want to be able to collect taxes and appoint Russian crown prince. Mongol rule actually accidentally helped to shield Russian from being absorbed into the German Empire.  

Maybe because of this period, Slavic and Asian people have certain mutual respect and common suspicion for Western European powers.

Russian language is based on the Cryillic script which is being used as national script in various Slavic, Turkic and Persian-speaking countries. 

Two missionary brothers from Eastern Roman Empire: Saints Cyril and Methodius created the Glagolitic letters to able to translate the Bible into Slavic sounds for Slavic speaking people. 

A Bulgarian emperor understood that a ruler can use war to protect or expand a nation’s territorials but he needs culture to stabilize and solidify an enduring nation. So he ordered students of Saints Cyril and Methodius to create the Cyrilic alphabet from Greek and Glagolitic letters  to unite different Slavic tribes under a single nation. This is why Russian alphabet is closer to Greek alphabet than Latin alphabet.

As of 2019, 250 million people ( almost equal to the size of the United States) is using Cyralic alphabets. 

Soviet Union has the land, the people and the ports and it was the second largest economy in the world until the opening of second money printing facility in Fort Worth in 1987 and the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990. 

The biggest problem for Russia after the collapse of Soviet Union is its declining population and loss of important sea ports. Maybe Peter the Great’s city is the answer.

### Evolution from Kievan Rus to Moscow Russia
![The Genetics Influence of Russia](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/genetics_influences_of_russia.png)

#Russia and #Ukraine have the largest arable land in Europe and they were and still are major producers of farming products to the Western European market but do not have a long history of developing complex social and military structures.

#Serf-dom or #Slav-dom is a farmer social class who are not allowed to move around but stay year around at the farm to work on it, have to pay a large percentage of their farming output to the kings and nobles who control the land, horses and major water sources via the use of forces. 

#Slav-dom was the largest social class in Eastern Europe until the 19th century because of Russia's large arable land area. 

Before mechanization, without the farmers, there would be no one to work on the farms and the Russian kings and nobles would have no income or valuable goods to trade for furs and other luxury items from Western Europe, Scandinavia and the Black Sea. 

The #Romanov dynasty, a Roman-Tatar lineage, built the Moscow fortress faraway from two Eastern European major rivers, the Dnieper and Volga in order to keep their slaves from running away as well as avoiding surprise raids from their enemies.

The Moscow fortress was able to accumulate the most amount of Slav farmers as well as keeping them safe from being killed by raids from the Mongol in the East or German in the West. 

With large area of farmland, most amount of farmers and no flood, #Moskova or много коровыp or Most Cows, developed a large fleet of cattles for meat and milk, expanded their population quickly and became the richest and strongest city state in #Russia. 

### Putin - The Russian Dream

All men dream: but not equally. Those that dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible -- T.E. Lawrence, “Lawrence of Arabia”.

Every man, woman, child and even dog dreams. 

However, in certain societies and environments, more people have enough conviction to go out during the day to pursue their dreams and aspirations while in others, most people lost their confidence, accept their faith and believe their night dream is just a dream.

If Mark Zukerberg, Steve Jobs, Barack Obama are examples of a self-made American dream. Well mostly self-made. Then Vladimir Putin is an example of a self-made Russian dream. 

Putin was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia while the city is still named as Leningrad after Vladimir Lenin, the founder of Soviet Union. 

Peter the Great has a Turkist mom reflecting the multiculturism root of Russia in contrast with more conservative, less diverse Western European. 

Maybe that why Soviet Union has quickly gained support around the world and their ideas were spreading like wild fire without any shot being fired by Russian throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America. 

Vladimir Putin's farther was a common cook for Vladimir Lenin and his mom is a common factory worker. Putin was the third child being born after two brothers dealths, one in pregnancy and the other during the siege of Leningrad in World War II. 

From this humble background, Putin follows a very similiar career path of George H.W Bush, first as an intelligent officer and military man of the KGB, then Saint Petersburg city officier, then Moscow city bureaucrats. 

July 25, 1998, Putin became the Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian CIA. 

Then come 1999, when Vladimir Putin career suddenly took off like a rocketship. 

Aug 9, 1999, he was appointed one of three Deputy Prime Ministers. Later that evening, he became the acting Prime Minister. 

One week later on Aug 16, 1999, Putin became Prime Minister after winning the State Duma election. 

December 31, 1999, Yeltsin resigned and according to Russia constitution, Vladimir Putin would become president. Most likely Yeltsin's safe landing and Putin becoming Russia's President is part of a secret deal.

Since the beginning of 21 century, Putin is the main driving force that pull Russian people out of poverty and reassert Russia in the world stage as the major world power.  

So why 2 important men in Russia: Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Lenin named Vladimir. Well because Vladimir is the medievel capital of Russia, the cradle of the great Russian language and nationality, which gradually evolved into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. 

Today, there are still standing the Golden Gate of Vladimir, East of modern Moscow along side with the Golden Gate of Constantinnople, modern Instanbul, Turkey and the Victory Column of Prussia, modern Berlin, Germany. 

These three important monuments and its relative capital cities are forming the Winter Triangle that will potentially open up the golden era of Euro-Asia continent. Maybe once again, Euro-Asia continent will be the main driving force that shapes human civilization destiny. 

### Russia and Its Siberian Stockpile of Nuclear, Chemical and Biological WMD.

Putin did a lot for Russia and Russian people whether people around the world like him or not. If Russia did transition directly into a Western democracy model, it was probably broken up even into smaller sub-countries and being at the mercy of other larger world powers like the United Kingdom and the United States for the rest of 21 century.

Russia is huge with the massive untapped Siberia era. It needs much more driven, smart, adventurous people to take advantage of this massive potential. 
Russia could be the new brain and beauty magnet of Euro Asia this century.

While the US, UK and European Union are seeing the rising of conservative, anti-immigrant parties and politicians, Russia is opening up its border to welcome foreigners. Many of these immigrants are victims of wars and climate changes, very similar to the massive migrant wave to America during World War I and World War II. 

Siberia, the harsh frontier of Russia, could potentially become the New New World. Russia could create an open immigration policies to Cyrillic script countries as well as other Middle Eastern refugees.  

They can teach Russian language to refugees, convert them into Christian Othordox, give them education and training similar to the Soviet Era's policies for Communist countries. 

They could also lease 100 years land settlement in Siberia to these new refugees to take advantage of new farming land appearing as a result of global warming around Lake Baika. An increase in food production is essential for the huge upstick in Russian population. 

Maybe the WWII beef between Germany and Russia could be resolved through an immigration and refugees program between the EU and Russia. A program like the carbon footprint credit that will have Germany and EU covered the bill for Russia to settle this massive wave of climate change refugees and immigrants to Siberia.  

In the end, the Alta Mountain was the birthplace of Egyptian pharaoh ancestors as well as the destination of a crucial out of Africa journey that triggered a sudden jump of human into an apex predator in the animal kingdom.
