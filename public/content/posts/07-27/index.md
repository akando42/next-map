## One Korea And The Awakening Of Third Asian Tigers

### The Founding of United Korea

918 AD, The Korean Peninsula was fully united the first time as the Kingdom of Goryeo. 

After a period of internal in-fighting between three kingdoms, Silla,  Later Baekjie and Later Goguryeo, Wang Geon, a gifted military commander via a coup and several successful military campaigns again Silla and Later Baekjie officially end the Korean Peninsula civil war.

Wang Geon’s Kingdom of Goryeo would oversee an unprecedented flourishing of Korean culture and its name is the origin of modern Korea’s English name. 

Wang Geon was given the posthumous title of Taejo meaning 'Great Founder.'

Wang Geon was born in 877 to a powerful merchant family based in Songak, modern Kaesong. 

Geon’s family gained great wealth via ocean trading with China and Japan. 

Wang Geon traced his ancestors to the first known Korean Kingdom of Goguryeo with its ancient capital of Pyongyang, modern North Korea capital.

Wang Geon was a big believer in Pungsu, the practice of meticulously selection of geographical locations to take advantage of natural energy forces. He applied Pungsu carefully in his choices of main and regional capitals' location.

Goryeo’s capital was at Kaesong, the modern Kaesong Industrial Complex, next to the Ryeong River.

The Kaesong location serveed as geo-political glue that encourages the culture and commercial exchange between North and South as well as reduces internal infighting.

The Kingdom Goryeo lasted for more than 400 years until the appearance of Mongolian force in 13 century. 

### North - South division, how did it happen ?

Before the end of WWII, Korea was under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean peninsula along the 38th parallel into North and South Korea. The North follows the Soviet Communist model and the South follows the American capitalist model.

A unification election for the entire Korean peninsula, very similar to Vietnam later in 1954, was promised but never happened. 

![38th Parallel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Korea_DMZ.svg/1280px-Korea_DMZ.svg.png)

1949, The Communist Chinese forces drove the Nationalist Kuomintang force off Mainland China to Taiwan and ended the Chinese Civil War. 

Nationalist Kuomintang Chinese Government still hold a UN seat after the end of Chinese Civil War until 1971.

Now the Communist bloc turned their focus to the Korean Peninsula 

29 August 1949, Soviet Union also successfully tested its first nuclear weapon. 

June 25 - 1950, with the military equipment aids from China and Russia, North Korea forces crossed the 38th parallel in an attempt to unify the Korean peninsula under Communist leadership.
 
Under-equipped and under-prepared South Korean Army were caught by surprise. After 4 days on June 28,  Seoul - the capital city of South Korea has fallen.

June 30, President Truman authorize Far East Commander in Chief to use all available force to stop the North Korean invasion. 

July 7, 1950, The United Nation passed Security Council Resolution 84 on to deploy military forces in Korean peninsula with:
7 supports from the UK, Ecuador, France, Norway and the United States, the Nationalist Chinese Government (Taiwan),  Cuba ( under Batista government).
3 abstains from Egypt, India and Yugoslavia.
1 Absent from Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power.

So why Soviet Union did not just stop their boycotting and show up to veto the intervention ?

Maybe he just does not expect the UN will actually get enough votes to send ground forces to intervene into another country's internal politics. 

Maybe he thought the force is on his side and North Korean would be able to end the war before any UN force would be able to set foot on South Korean shore.

Maybe he wants the American to get dragged into a war with China and leave his Southern border worry free.

No one knows, ask Stalin.

By Aug 4, with US and UN support, the Southern Korean forced was still pushed back to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter in the southern tip of South Korea 

An army of 140,000 UN troops were rallied to make a final stand against 98,000 North Korean army at Pusan port area.

![Pusan](https://previews.dropbox.com/p/thumb/AAjq5hqoJBtHVWjW1q2Fx8HfXSsAtIL6oKs9FoXTCTtqTRx1B-IskxJFQ0c4AwS4NIbZyttQkeqIIvn1X1cEgkRxtCYiBfT__EagfthZm3hQMk46Nw1skDxh9PE-_k7H85pm0OaTjQAnRbUyo05KcjBEM59FuxzSwiAqGeTy9Cd7s6Q-rZNeuvcXjPsXdS1yn7YG1RIGpg_VN0AfBymwsGaYR3u6pWl1_IvS_MJHDXzIFXinLlK4vobmMM1JoUd8oOeK3lJhinFKxYADeczizYd47Wcxb37Gna318W3QcNK-QLOdkCis6X7ESvYFQ-ewAvJUPtKYUe3aMYry2HZ3Lqyx/p.png?fv_content=true&size_mode=5) 

However, UN force with unchallenged Air and Naval support as well as continuous new troop landing at Pusan port was able to make a stand against further North Korean assaults. 

UN troops dealt a decisive blow by executing landing near Inchon near Seoul and successfully cut the North Korean supplyline. North Korea was forced to retreat and push all the way back to Pyongyang. Oct 19 1950, Pyongyang was captured

However, too eager from his continuous victories and want to continue the success momentum, MacArthur pushed American troops close to the Chinese border near the Yalu River and fell into a trap.

Oct 25, Chinese PVA 13th Army Group secretly crossed the Yalu River and made a surprise attack on the UN forces.

![Yalu River](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/China_Crosses_Yalu.jpg)

They inflicted heavy casualties to UN forces at the battle of Onjong, battle of Unsan, the battle of ChongChon river and the battle of Chosin Reservoir.  

After mounting loses, UN forces have to withdraw back to South Korea across the 38 Parallel by mid December. 

Chinese and North Korean forces launched their third offensive campaign on Dec 26 and captured Seoul the second time January 4, 1951.

General MacArther was considering using Nuclear Weapons against Chinese and North Korean forces and risk starting WW3 nuclear war and was removed by Truman in June 1951. 

The fighting felt into a stalemate from July 1951 to 1953 and on July 30, 1953 the North Korean Armistice Agreement was signed between UN Command, North Korean KPA and Chinese PVA to cease fire. 

No peace settlement has been achieved in Korea peninsula since this Armistice agreement. 

So why Kim Jong Un wants his Nuclear Weapon ? Well because MacArther was very close to use US Nuclear Weapon against North Korea and Chinese forces during the Korean War and his grandfather as well as Wikipedia told him that.

### Modern Unified Korea and Its Potential in the Global Stage

Korean path to unification is pretty mucky. China probably wants a buffer state between its border and American military bases. 

North Korea no longer possesses any element of surprises and the outcome of trying to overrun the heavily fortified DMZ would be heavy losses and potential collapse of North Korea state itself.

One potential scenario would lead to the Korean Peninsula unification that would get external support from China and the US is:

South Korea military becomes self-sustainable with potential nuclear-deterrence capability. Japan might not like this and get a nuke themselves. 

US foreign policies would shift its focus to Latin America and internal affairs and the US bases in South Korea would become too expensive and unnecessary. 

North and South Korea peace agreement leading to the single unified democratically elected government and Kim Dynasty would keep his wealth and potential monarchy title like Japanese emperor or Queen of England.

So how a unified Korea would look like:

A combined North-South Korea possesses vast natural resource and mineral as well as infrastructure and sea port that would be a great boost to the overall Korean industrial strength. 

An South-Korean educated North Korean young workforce would at least double Korea GDP from current 1.6 Trillion USD to 3 Trillion USD after ONE decade, surpassing the United Kingdom to take the number 5 spot after US, China, Japan and Germany. 

A combined population of 75 millions plus potential North Korea larger population growth would put Korea next to Germany in population size. 

An entire East and West coastline from North to South would open up vast potential trading ports and commerce with US, China and Japan. 

The greatest potential leap would be better resource allocation from defensive military spending to economic development, education and outward naval capability.
