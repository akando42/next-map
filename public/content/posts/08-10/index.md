### Aqua Sapien, Han Kanji Alphabet and the Wet Rice Culture
In a semiaquatic life-style, the female aquatic ape looks for water-submersive plant-based sources while the male aquatic ape would go fishing and hunting wild animal while they were drinking water. The wild wet-rice naturally became the stable food sources that the aquatic female ape would be able to cultivate reliably everyday.

After thoundsand years of harvesting wild wet rice, the divine peasant and agriculture god, Shannong, the forefather of every rice-paddy culture like Japan, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh starts to grow rice in his neighborhood lands instead of just relying on his wife wild-rice harvesting activities.

The Monsoon weather system in East India and East Asia contributes to the adoption of wet rice as main stable food source for the Aquasapien civilizations in this region of the world. Food security from wet rice farming technique results in surplus of time for the rice farmers and allow him to build better settlements as well as raising more kids and keep his family healthy. More free times from food security also results in more complex society with different social classes who choose to spend their new gain freetime differently after each full meals.

The delta flatland gains most from the Monsoon weather system and produce the highest output of wet rice per square kilometer of farmland. The HAN Chinese number and writing system was developed probably to record trading and major historical events among food surplus settlements around the Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta of Vietnam, Pearl River Delta, Yangzte River Delta and Yellow River Deltas of China, Taedong River Delta and Han River Delta of Korea and Tone River Delta of Japan.

With the same high carbonhydrate food sources to boost human activities and closely similiar gene pools, the largest river delta of Yellow-Yangzte river come to dominate early East Asian civilizations with cultures in Vietnam, Southern China, Northern China, Manchuria, Korea, Japan all adopt the same Han Chinese writing system, Han Chinese wet rice farming techniques and Han Chinese Confucius governing and architecture.

The East Asia civilizations stayed Yellow Yangzte Han Chinese centrics with Han Chinese ruling dynasties as the central of gravity or the Sun for East Asia civilizations. Newest ideas, technologies, food, fashion and architecture trends started in Yellow Yangzte delta and then spreaded to outer rim regions of China in South East Asia, Korea and Japan. However, the high speed current of the Tsushima Strait and Japanese high Western mountain ranges enabled Japan isolation and prevented Japanese clans from fully fallen into the Han Chinese orbit and became a province of Chinese dynasties like Taiwan.

And then, everything changed in early 1600 EDO period with the introduction of new DNA lineages, the females type D and Type O in the city of EDO, the formal name of Tokyo. Just like how the foreign African lineages helped the Western colonial powers to alter ecosystem balance and subdue Native American tribes, the new Egg D and O babies introduced in the Edo or Tokyo port city growing up and being armed with Fire-powder guns quickly centralized fragmented Japanese clans and turned Japan from an Isolationist to an Expansionist society that will rival Han Chinese influences in the next 500 years. 

![Type D or O Unifier of Japan during Edo Period](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/toyotomi_hideyoshi.png)

These type D and O babies of the EDO periods built many castles around Japan like the Western European castles, launched their first expansion into Korea peninsula and started to replace the Han Chinese Ming dynasty culture, military and political influences with their own.  

![Osaka Castle](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/japanese_and_austrian_castles.png)

In the next 200 years after the first Type D and Type O babies and the first invasion of Korean peninsula, these new Japanese lineages turned a small port city of EDO into one of the world largest metropolitan that would rival the size of Beijng on the other side of the Yellow sea. They turned most of the EDO delta into farmland and rapidly expand the type D and type O genetics footprint in this most fertile area of Japan.

These EDO warlords would become so rich being the middlemen trading Chinese and Japanese goods and captured slaves with the West at the period when Chinese ports were fully closed to foreign Westerners. With their new-found richest, they can travel to most famous Western cities and sent agents to buy the newest Western weapons and technologies. American and Portugese traders also brought the lightest but rarest items they could find in the West to trade with Japan so they can make a profitable trip home in their fully packed ocean vessels.

These EDO delta warlords would become so powerful that they would dominate other more Han-Chinese warlords of Japan in Nagoya and Osaka delta and even be able to move the emperor and the capital of Japan from KYOTO to EDO and renamed the city of EDO to TOKYO.

### Meiji Era Rapid Industrialization and the Japanization of Western Technology
After the second Opium war early 1800s between European colonial powers and the Qing dynasty of China, all Chinese ports are now open to Western trades. British, Gerrman, French, Dutch, Portugese now can trade directly with the Chinese merchants using their highly addictive substance of Opium. Japanese traders at the beginning of Meiji era and post Opium war can no longer trade Chinese and Japanese goods for the newest weapons and technologies from the West. 

The rich Japanese warlords of Tokyo have to start to reverse engineers Western products and weapons and build factories to build those items directly in Japan for Japanese. The Tokyo Delta farmland area quickly urbanized with Japanese farmers from Tokyo delta as well as other deltas moving to the port city of Tokyo to work inside industralized factories.

![Japanese Textile Factory](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/meiji-era-textile-machine.png)

These newly built factories were mass manufacturing clothing, printing books, making riffles for the Japanese Imperial ArmY. For the first time, every young male within the fighting age in Japan is equipped with an uniform, trained in Western military tactics and was capable of eliminating multiple males of all sizes and ages with riffles made in Japan.

The Japanese traders and agents with extensive knowledge of Western Europe market realized that British and French were making superior Steam-powered Iron ocean vessels and advised the Emperor and Warlords of Japan to purchase these vessels from Britain to equip the Japanese Imperial Navy. With that purchase decision, Japan naturally joined the Allied Power of France and England during World War 1 and were able to eliminate the Russian Far-East Navy during the Battle of Tsushima and became the first East Asian navy to be able to win a naval battle against a Western power. 

![Battle of Tsushima](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/defeat_of_russian_navy_1905.png)

Following the victory of Japan against Russian navy, the Japanese ability to purchase any kind of lethal weapons from the West is severely restricted. The newest Western technologies now would be kept secret from Japanese traders and agents. These new trade regulation and technology transfer control measure of Western powers furtherly forces Japan to make everything domestically and only can import raw material and scrapped metals from abroad. At the beginning of World War 2, even scrapped metals imported from the United States was embargo and the radar technology invented in Britain was kept secret from Germany and Japan. Radar technology ended up to be the deciding factor stopping the Germany Airforce from achieving air superiority over the sky of Britain and led to the defeat of Japanese Imperial navy in the battle of Midway.

### Human Capital is The True Power of a Nation Economy

If the Western world switch their diet to a more energy efficient source, we will definitely see more population growth in the West. A clear example is a higher birth rate in the United States than in Europe because Chinese, Korean and Japanese food are popular in US while they are not very popular and do not become a daily food source in Europe.

Being able to raise a child in any countries is the Relative Living Standard equation not a Absolute Income equation. When everyone around you are richer than you then you are not going to be able to raise a child since it cost more to trade for what you need.

When everyone else around you are just poor like you, we are all sucker who are willing to trade for less so child care would be cheaper, food would be cheaper and medicine would be cheaper. So it is good to live in a rich neighborhood yeah if you are richer than the average.

Do not get more wrong. High living standard and good wealth distribution will still result in good economic growth and good population growth which translate into expanding genetics footprint. And low living standard will result in weak infrastructure and become victims of economic and military imperialism.

If you do not build empire then you are the slaves.

Not more land, not more money, just more skilled people and more trade will ensure perpetual economic growth.

Asia and Its Paddy Field ensure superior food production per square meter which enables massive population growth.
When the living standard (housing, education and infrastructure) of the majority of these population centers increases to parity to the West we will see economic dominance. 

Currently Japan + China is already dwarfing the US Economy while the majority of the South East Asia and South Asia economy is still under-developed. India with its heavily federated government structure does not have the necessary infrastructure to achieve growth and improvement in living standard that we are seeing China and elsewhere yet.

## The Vote that Tips the IMF Currency Basket
All advanced economies are able to produce highly complex product that is very difficult to copy but everyone wants their products. American loves Japanese and German cars while Japanese and German needs American recon and attack weapons to defend their territorials. American needs Chinese consumer electronics while Chinese needs the American ocean freeway to transport oil and gas from the Middle East. 

![IMF Currency Basket](https://storage.googleapis.com/spykman-world/IMF_Currency_Basket.png)

Most of human-made products though is subject to depreciation of value and since COVID-19, somehow China and US is gaining larger share in the IMF currency basket while Japan, Europe and United Kingdom is not doing as well as before. English vs non-English speaking world is still at a fragile balance while Atlantics vs Pacifics is a total domination of the narrower trade routes between the Atlantic nations.  

Japan could have tipped the scale with their superior products but Moscow tipped the scale in favor of the English speaking world with chaos, viruses and wars.
