## Paddy Field and the Unfair Advantage in Population Growth 

###### Paddy Field -- A Semiaquatic crop is the first stable food source for Aqua Sapien.
In a semiaquatic life-style, the female aquatic ape looks for different food sources beside the fish and wild pig hunting activities of the male aquatic ape. 

Pig is another mammal with no hair, a proof of their past semi-aquatic lifestyle and their regular mud bathing habits.

Divine peasant and agriculture god, Shannong is the forefather of every rice-paddy culture like Japan, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh.

There are a direct correlation between population growth and food…  If the Western world switch their diet to a more energy efficient source, we will definitely see more population growth in the West.

A clear example is a higher birth rate in the United States than in Europe because Chinese, Korean and Japanese food are popular in US while they are not very popular and do not become a daily food source in Europe.

Being able to raise a child in any countries… is the Relative Living Standard equation … not a Absolute Income equation When everyone around you are richer than you… you are not going to be able to raise a child since it cost more to trade for what you need.

When everyone else around you are just poor like you, we are all sucker who are willing to trade for less so child care would be cheaper, food would be cheaper and medicine would be cheaper.

So it is good to live in a rich neighbor… yeah if you are richer than the average.

Do not get more wrong. High living standard and good wealth distribution will still result in good economic growth and good population growth which translate into expanding genetics footprint.

And low living standard will result in weak infrastructure and become victims of economic and military imperialism. If you do not build empire then you are the slaves.

###### Human Capital is The True Power of a Nation Economy

Not more land, not more money, just more skilled people and more trade will ensure perpetual economic growth.
Asia and Its Paddy Field ensure superior food production per square meter… which enables massive population growth.
When the living standard (housing, education and infrastructure) of the majority of these population centers increases to parity to the west… we will see economic dominance. 

Currently Japan + China is already dwarfing the US Economy while the majority of the South East Asia and South Asia economy is still under-developed. India with its heavily federated government structure does not have the necessary infrastructure to achieve growth and improvement in living standard that we are seeing China and elsewhere.


###### Kra River and The Future of Kra Canal
The Kra Canal that enabled the prosperity of the MeKong Delta and took the knife off China's throat and placing it on Alaska.


## The Vote that Tips the IMF Currency Basket
USD + GBP < EUR + CNY + JPY because 41.73 + 8.09 < 30.93 + 10.92 + 8.33

USD + GBP + JPY > EUR + CNY because 41.73 + 8.09 + 8.33 > 30.93 + 10.92

So Deep Science means Superior Weapon because Physics could be scary.
