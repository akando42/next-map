### Paddy Field -- A Semiaquatic crop is the first stable food source for Aqua Sapien.
In a semiaquatic life-style, the female aquatic ape looks for water-submersive plant-based sources while the male aquatic ape would go fishing and hunting wild animal while they were drinking water. The wild wet-rice naturally became the stable food sources that the aquatic female ape would be able to cultivate reliably everyday.

After thoundsand years of harvesting wild wet rice, the divine peasant and agriculture god, Shannong, the forefather of every rice-paddy culture like Japan, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh starts to grow rice in his neighborhood lands instead of just relying on his wife wild-rice harvesting activities.

There are a direct correlation between population growth and the abundance of food. If the Western world switch their diet to a more energy efficient source, we will definitely see more population growth in the West. 

A clear example is a higher birth rate in the United States than in Europe because Chinese, Korean and Japanese food are popular in US while they are not very popular and do not become a daily food source in Europe.

Being able to raise a child in any countries is the Relative Living Standard equation not a Absolute Income equation. When everyone around you are richer than you then you are not going to be able to raise a child since it cost more to trade for what you need.

When everyone else around you are just poor like you, we are all sucker who are willing to trade for less so child care would be cheaper, food would be cheaper and medicine would be cheaper. So it is good to live in a rich neighborhood yeah if you are richer than the average.

Do not get more wrong. High living standard and good wealth distribution will still result in good economic growth and good population growth which translate into expanding genetics footprint. And low living standard will result in weak infrastructure and become victims of economic and military imperialism.

If you do not build empire then you are the slaves.

### Human Capital is The True Power of a Nation Economy

Not more land, not more money, just more skilled people and more trade will ensure perpetual economic growth.

Asia and Its Paddy Field ensure superior food production per square meter which enables massive population growth.
When the living standard (housing, education and infrastructure) of the majority of these population centers increases to parity to the West we will see economic dominance. 

Currently Japan + China is already dwarfing the US Economy while the majority of the South East Asia and South Asia economy is still under-developed. India with its heavily federated government structure does not have the necessary infrastructure to achieve growth and improvement in living standard that we are seeing China and elsewhere yet.

### Kra River and The Future of Kra Canal
The Kra Canal that enabled the prosperity of the MeKong Delta and took the knife off China's throat and placing it on Alaska.


## The Vote that Tips the IMF Currency Basket
All advanced economies are able to produce highly complex product that is very difficult to copy but everyone wants their products. American loves Japanese and German cars while Japanese and German needs American recon and attack weapons to defend their territorials. American needs Chinese consumer electronics while Chinese needs the American ocean freeway to transport oil and gas from the Middle East.

Most of human-made products though is subject to depreciation of value and since COVID-19, somehow China and US is gaining larger share in the IMF currency basket while Japan, Europe and United Kingdom is not doing as well as before. English vs non-English speaking world is still at a fragile balance while Atlantics vs Pacifics is a total domination of the narrower trade routes between the Atlantic nations.  

Japan could have tipped the scale with their superior products but Moscow tipped the scale in favor of the English speaking world with chaos, viruses and wars.
