### Asymmetrical Warfare
Asymmetrical warfare tactics are normally used by weaker opponents against stronger actors to avoid a conventional high-intensity warfare by prolonging the war or expanding the battle field to a larger area to spread the advantage of more advanced, larger force.

The words Terror in the War Against Terror is an English translation of the French word
La Terreur, the bloodiest period during the French revolution from September 5, 1793 to July 27, 1794. 

During the La Terreur, any political opposition to the French revolution would be heavily persecuted via the Revolutionary Tribunal and punished by lynching or beheaded leading to the result of 300,000 suspects were arrested, 17000 people were executed and 10,000 died in prision without trials. 

Is terrorism a tactic in the same asymetrical warfare category with guerilla warfare, cyberattack, faked news and disinformation?

How do you define terrorism ? According to the CIA website, the term “terrrorism” means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. 

Civilian casualties in any war is a norm not a special case and most wars are for political purposes. 

So I would argue that the danger of terrorism lays in its origin of subnational and clandestine agents since these groups could be international and has no diplomatic relationship with targeted nations.These groups also have no single capital or permanent central government. 

It is a lot like fighting against a Lernaean Hydra. Each time you cut off one head, two new one would reappear. There is an interesting meme talking about GBU-43 nicknamed mother of all bomb: 10,000 new terrorists in a single blast. 

A terrorist attack can happen any time any where. The battle field has been expanded to anywhere on earth and can continuously happen indefinitely.  

So how do you fight against terrorism ?

Well the first very counterintuitive step would be helping the beast to have a strong one single head. Terrorist groups normally thrive in countries with weak and dysfunctional governments and very few terrorism groups in countries with strong central government. This is very similar to the Good Friday Agreement with the IRA in the Northern Ireland conflict. 

United States does not want a weak central Chinese state cause that would be the worst terrorism group that they would have ever experienced. 

The second step is to establish diplomatic relationship with this strong central government and make sure the strong central government is fully established with stable economy, police and military forces, most importantly a full fledged legal system . No hostile act or ground invasion should be conducted against this strong central government regardless of political differences. 

The third step is to become an ally with this strong central government or just cut that one single head off and place a friendly one on.

### False Flag Operation
However, what if 9/11 was a false flag operation to legitimize a Middle East war and gain control of the major energy reserves to ensure energy security for American economy. 

The US Economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas. Germany lost World War II because of their lack of access to oil and gas reserves. 

The 1973 oil shock caused by the Oil Embargo placed on Israel’ Allies by Arab nations show a vulnerability of the US economy. The first oil shock of 1973 happens while George H.W Bush was the UN Ambassador as well as the chairman of the Republican National Committee. 

George H.W Bush was an oil businessman and become a millionaire by the age of 40 because of his fortune in the oil industry. After the first swift and successful Iraq war of 1991, maybe George H.W Bush come up with a 10 years plan to come back and ensure American energy security once and for all. 

After all, the reason George H.W Bush volunteered for the Navy was because of the oil Embargo on Japan and their eventual last resource attack on Pearl Harbor. 

An exclusive access to the Middle East oil fields for Oil Corporation also ensure Texas economic strength for decades to come as well as solidify the Bush powerbase. 

The Exxon and Mobil merger in 1999 and become the largest energy company in the world with their headquarters in Texas. Now the Bush has the largest corporation in the world to back their plan. 

Clinton’s impeachment, Tech bubble’s crash and Bush son became the president, the central gravity of power needs its one last kick to move from West and East coast back the South. 

All the stars have aligned and the time to execute the 10 years plan has come. The 9-11 attack ensure three things:
United States once again increase its military spending from 1999 post WWII level of 3.45% of GDP to 5.65 % GDP by 2012. 
Oil price once again increase from its 1999 low of $30/gallon to $160/gallon by 2008.
Exxon Mobil has exclusive unlimited access to Iraq's oil fields after the Afghan and Iraq war. 

Maybe this is the reason why once again, Republican and Russian oligarch works together to ensure a fossil fuel future of the world. 

China will never be able to ensure its energy security if it continues to depend on oil and gas. 
Its highly vulnerable energy transport route via Indian Ocean and its lack of comparable naval forces to protect this route in case of war is forcing it into an electric future. 

Tesla and China are pulling the world out of oil/gas to a future of electrics way too rapidly. 

Both Texas and Russian economy are defense and energy based so they have aligned interest in crashing the Chinese economy, slowing down the transition away from fossil fuels to electrics and a global increase in military spending. 

There is a direct link between Russia's largest oil corporation LukOil, Ted Crush and Cambridge Analytica. 

### A Knock - Putin, the mastermind, 2 Terror Attacks To Make Russia Great Again.

Last but most dangerous is that 9/11 is a knock to test the response of American Homeland air defenses for future campaigns as well as drawing America into a War that will eventually weaken the country. 

Putin did not become the main guy in Russian until the shocked bombing of 4 apartment buildings in Russia from September 4 - September 16, 1999. 

Now the Russian people are trembling and in need of a strong, military man with intelligent background like George H.W Bush to lead them. 

The 9/11 attacks also have 4 targets. Number 4 and its four horsemen has significant 
meaning in Christianity’s Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, very little meaning in Islam. 

So maybe the person who decides the number of targets is a deeply religious Christian man.

Putin did make a call to warn about the attack on September 9, 2001 but was ignored nevertheless. A call from Putin, an American adversary, will ensure all warning of 9/11 will be ignored as false intelligence. 

Just like the actual 9/11 event is very similar to NORAD exercises of potential airplane hijacking leading to the slow and no response from American Air Control and Air Defenses. 

NORAD radar system is outdated and American was not prepared for or expected a homeland invasion.

US air defense was built on the believe that the best defense is a good offense. 
The missile defense network was built to counter ballistic missile from Soviet Union.

The Nike SAM system has been removed after the Cold War with the believe that no bombers would be able to reach the US mainland.

Maybe Texas and its confederate belief wants to be an independent nation.  

Donald Trump became US President in 2016, accelerating American budget deficit and money printing, leading the world closer is a Gold Standard without US Dollar as the world reserve currency. Donald Trump is helping to weaken Russian only strong neighbor in the Old World, China. 

With US gradual withdrawal from the Middle East, Russian become the big brother of the OPEC. The US and UK is also weakening NATO with Brexit, trade wars with EU and it protectionism trade policies.

The US is asking NATO members and its allies to pay for their own defenses, a great opportunity for Germany and Japan military build up without original WW2 constraints in place. Maybe Germany and Russia won’t be on opposite side this time.

American focus and budget allocation toward its Southern border and its strangle relationship with its Northern neighbor Canada could prove to be fatal later on.

Very few border defenses between Canada and the USA and open plain from Northern West Canada to US Heartland that is perfect for tanks blitz invasion, looking similar to open plane of Germany and Ukraine during World War II. 

Newfoundland has actually seen the appearance as well as sinking of German U Boat. Its distance is close enough to New York and Washington DC. 

Would nuclear deterrence works if the invasion force is inside American mainland. 

What if the nuclear launch mechanism is disable electronically or the US President is actually controlled by foreign power and in support of the invasion. 

CIA placing a friendly dictator as president of a country is a norm but a foreign power placing a dictator on top as US president is unprecedented but not impossible. 

Maybe after thousands of years, the Viking eventually rule the world. English, French, German and Russian are Vikings. US will be Viking’s land soon. They discovered America way before Columbus anyway.
