# Hard Power, Soft Power and the Pink Power
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fspykmanworld%2Fvideos%2F439026116703745%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

America power projection was built on a trinity of power with three pillars. 

First pillar is its military strength via elevent aircraft carriers, a global network of military bases and nuclear triads. 

Second pillar is its financial strength via US Dollar Bills as the currency reserve, World Bank and the IMF to create financial and political influence via lending. 

Third pillar is the Pornography as well as Hollywood Movie and Entertainment Industry. 

According to Joseph Nye, large countries can yield Hard power and Soft power to influence small countries’ behaviors. I would argue that he forgot or think it is too controversial to mention the third one: the Pink Power. 

Every American and global audience knew about the Stormy Daniel and Donald Trump sex tape scandal. I would argue that Stormy Daniel is the best thing that could happen to Donald Trump domestic as well as global influence. The scandal served as a pink power projection, reaching deep inside each man and woman subconscious psyche.  

So how American competitors can counter these three pillars of power. 

Conventional hard power via ‘gun-powder’ could be countered via public opinion, ideology, religion or simply more ‘gun-powder’. However with WMD, the only way to counter is to also have WMD to be used as deterrence. Since the Soviet Union’s successful development of Nuclear Weapon, not a single case of Nuclear Weapon has ever been used.  

The Dollar as the world reserve currency gives America tremendous influence but could be diminished via the gold standard or simply a new balance basket of alternative reserve currencies.

Pornography, the movie and entertainment industry could be countered via  sexual liberation or get control of the porn script and shape public opinion via porn. Brazil has the hottest people in the world but no porn or movie industry.
