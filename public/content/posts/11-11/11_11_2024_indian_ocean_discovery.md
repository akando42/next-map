# Indian Ocean Gene Groups Competion

Before the arrival of the British Navy, the Mongol Genes and their Horses dominated most of the Indian Subcontinent and East Asia. The Mongol married princesses from the Karachi River Delta and established the Mughal empire with two capitals in Multan and Delhi. 

Britain controlled the Indian Subcontinent starting with two coastal port cities of Bombay and Fort Saint George. With help from the Indian Mercenaries equipped with British guns and bombs from Bombay, the British Royal Navy was able to overrun Indian Royal Imperial Cities of Delhi and Multan and gain control of the entire Indian Subcontinent. 

In the New World, the British equipped African slaves with modern guns while the French equipped Native American with modern guns. Even with the understanding of terrain from Native American, the British-African alliance was able to defeat the French Native American alliance. This first successful British-African alliance in the new world later on resulted in the NATO North Atlantic Treaty organization.  

After the French lost control of the United States and had to withdraw back to Quebec and Toronto, the French King lost his throne and his head. A new leader born in the Mediterranean sea called Napoleon was thrusted into the leading position of the French army and its rebuilt navy. May 1798, Napoleon launched the Nile campaign to gain control of Egypt and Israel to cut British access from the Suez canal.  While the trade route to the United States from Britain is still well protected, the Spice trade route to India is severely disrupted by the French military in the Middle East.

The British navy now had to take the long route from the UK to South Africa to Bombay and Saint George. Napoleon then launched the second Naval campaign to turn Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into a French ally base. French Indochina, according to Napoleon and its military adviser plan, will be the launch point to cut the British opium trades into China, a major source of revenue for British merchants and its navy. 

In 1800, Napoleonic French merchants and its military advisors were sent to Vietnam to support the Nguyen Anh wars against the Nguyen Hue mongol princes. The French equipped the Nguyen Anh and Thai mercenaries with guns, canons and western military tactics. 

With French naval ships, guns and cannons and Thai mercenaries, Nguyen Anh army was able to stop the continuous victorious campaigns of the Nguyen Hue Mongol princes in the Mekong delta. Nguyen Anh then sailed his force from Saigon to Hue and Hanoi on French naval ships and captured the formal Nguyen Hue capital, Hue and formal Tran capital of Thang Long. 

Nguyen Anh, a French ally, became the Emperor of Vietnam in 1802. To commemorate the friendship between Nguyen Anh and his French advisers, two Guard Towers were built in Son Tay and Hanoi with the help of French architects. Vietnamese troops and French advisers were also stationed in Son Tay and Ha Noi to stop the opium trade between Myanmar and Southern China through the Da River and Red River route. 

After two disruptive Napoleon attacks, the British royal called on their cousin in Moscow to attack Napoleon and pull all of his armies into attacking the Russian capital of Moscow on land. The Latino Mediterranean genes did not do well during the Long COLD Winter of Russia that the Germanic NORTH Men were adapted to. 

In 1812, Napoleon's Mediterranean army was able to reach the abandoned Moscow, burned it down but the French supplyline is over extended all the way from Paris with troops running low on bread ration. Russians with their Nomadic lifestyle pulled all castles, cows and sheeps to the countryside before French armies marched into Moscow, waited until the winter and then counterattacked. Most of Napoleon's army horses, artillery and elite troops perished during the Russian winter because of the lack of food and winter clothing. 

After the disastrous Russian campaign, by 1815 the Norman allies in Continental Europe were able to march on Paris and force the surrender from Napoleon. After the Napoleon de-throne, all treaties between the Nguyen Anh Imperial Court and the French Empire were nullified. To punish the alliance between Nguyen Anh and Napoleonic France, Norman French governors and British French troops were sent to Vietnam to override Nguyen Anh court authority in Vietnam. The Norman French applied harsh exploitative rules over the Vietnamese people and built the Norman Style Church in Central Hanoi called Nha Tho Lon.
