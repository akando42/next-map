Global warming and the melting Arctic will potentially give Russia a great edge over other superpowers. This Northwest passage will empower a heartland power with rimland's port and sea route.

Roald Amundsen's childhood dream might be key to wake up a hibernated Russia.

Centuries after Columbus discovered America by accident while sailing West searching for another route to India, European explorers continue to search for navigable passage as a possible faster, shorter trade route to Asia. 

An ice-bound northern route was discovered and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first to successfully sail from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean via the Northwest Passage from 1903-1906.

Roald Amundsen was born near Oslo July 16, 1872 into a Norwegian shipowners / captains in Borge. Despite his momâ€™s wish to encourage him to become a doctor, Amundsen quit medical school at the age of 21 for a life at sea. 

In 1903, with a small expedition team of six men and the Gjoa 13-horse power single-screw paraffin engine fishing vessel, Amundmen set sail to the North Sea from Kristinia, Norway to Greenland. 

From Greenland, Amundsen and his crew then sailed through Baffin Bay , Lancaster Sound , Beechey Island and finally to Gjoa Harbor, The King William Island and spend 2 years here conducting Magnetic research. 

At The King William Island, Amundsend came into contact with the local Inuit and learn many survival techniques from them. 

Amundsen set up 8 magnetic stations on the island to collect data for his research and become the 1st one to discover that the North Magnetic Pole does not have a permanent location but move around fairly regularly. 

Early Aug 1905,  they continue their trip West and navigate through the Simpson Strait on Aug 13, 1905 and then west through Cambridge Bay and south of Victoria Island. They cleared the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Aug 17 and completed their North West passage by reaching the Bering Strait Aug 30.

Today, July 16, 2019, more than 100 years after the first passage by Edmund, the NorthWest passage still have a tremendous potential that have not been tapped into. 

A direct trade route via the Northwest passage would cut distance between Rotterdam to Shanghai to less than 8000 miles instead of 10,500 mile via the Suez Canal or 13500 miles via the Panama Canal.
