Without the need for modern technological advances, the Tibetan High Mountain gene adaptation was able to allow this gene group to expand into the extreme climate condition of the Far North. Among all modern human gene groups, only the Tibetan Inuit was able to survive and settle in the Artics of Siberia and Canada with only food from Arctic animals as their sources of energy.

However, with both the Norwegian gene adaptation and British engineering, the European High North gene groups were able to not only survive but explore every coordinate of the Arctic Ocean, build large settlements of million inhabitants, dominate the Arctic circles with their cities of light, railroads, airports, natural gas power plants and pipelines.
