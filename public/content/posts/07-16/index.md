Without the need for modern technological advances, the Tibetan High Mountain gene adaptation was able to allow this gene group to expand into the extreme climate condition of the Far North. Among all modern human gene groups, only the Tibetan Inuit was able to survive and settle in the Artics of Siberia and Canada with only food from Arctic animals as their sources of energy.

However, with both the Norwegian gene adaptation and British engineering, the European High North gene groups were able to not only survive but explore every coordinate of the Arctic Ocean, build large settlements of million inhabitants, dominate the Arctic circles with their cities of light, railroads, airports, natural gas power plants and pipelines.

All these Arctic frontier conquerings started in with a Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen. Roald Amundsen was born near Oslo July 16, 1872 into Norwegian shipowners / captains family in Borge. In 1903, the explorer and his team of six men used the Gjoa 13-horse power single-screw paraffin engine fishing vessel setting sail West to find a path across from the Atlantics Ocean to the Pacifics Ocean through the Arctics Ocean.

The team first sailed Oslo formerly called Kristinia, Norway to Greenland. From Greenland, Amundsen and his crew then sailed through Baffin Bay to the Beechey Island and finally to Gjoa Harbor, The King William Island and spent 2 years here conducting Magnetic research. At King William Island, Amundsend came into contact and learned many survival techniques from the local Tibetan Asian Inuit. Amundsen also setup 8 magnetic stations on the island to collect data for his research and become the 1st one to discover that the North Magnetic Pole does not have a permanent location but moves around fairly regularly.

Summer, August 1905, they continued their trip West and navigated through the Simpson Strait and then West through Cambridge Bay south of Victoria Island. They cleared the Canadian Northern Coast and completed their North West passage by reaching the Bering Strait on Aug 30, 1905.

A direct trade route via the Northwest Canadian Passage would cut the distance between Rotterdam to Shanghai to less than 8000 miles instead of 10,500 miles via the Suez Canal or 13500 miles via the Panama Canal.

However, the United States do not export energy to China or Japan and prefer that Chinese and Japanese consumer goods would travel through the US controlled Panama Canal than over the empty Northern Canadian coast. In the opposite, after the Ukranian war, China energy hungry economy is the main and only reliable buyer of Russian energy export economy. Chinese consumer goods traveling via the Belt and Road railways to Russian major cities around Moscow in exchange for Russian oil and natural gas travelling via the Northern Sea Route is a highly repeatable and profitable business exchanges.

China is Russia largest trading partner with 14% of Russia exports sending to China and 25% of Russia imports coming from China. So both Russia and China have incentive to invest and develop the Northern Sea route along Russian coastline to avoid the Indian Ocean route controlled by US Navy and its 10 Aircraft Carriers. China is only 2nd largest trading partner after United States for Canada with only 4% of Canadian exports sending to China and 12% of Canadian import coming from China.

The will of macro planners also need the support from the masses. While many Russian Arctics and Near-Artics cities full of East Asian Russian who have incentives to cement the Chinese-Russian alliance and capabilities to surivive and build large settlements along side the Russian Northern Sea route, there are very few American, Chinese or Canadian who are willing to live along the isolated Canadian Northern coastline to maintain this potential trade route.

Largest Arctics population centers with genetics groups who are genetically adapted to Arctics climate as well as having experiences surving in this enviroment are concentrated in the Scandinavian and Russian Northern regions. Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Russia cities can all ultilize the Northern Russian sea routes to sell their energy products to China.
