### Irish Republican Army - An Independence Movement From Britain.

Attila, frequently called Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. URALIC people, descendants of Attila, spread from Hungary to the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian regions over the next 500 years.

The Vikings with their Attila gene and ADHD furious energy eventually finalized Altila’s Westward expansion in the 10th and 11th centuries. After continuous Vikings raids, the Franks people eventually gave in and Rollo, a Viking leader gain political legitimacy and start the Norman dynasty in the Normandy region, Northern France with profound influence on Medieval Europe.

Since the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12 century, the Irish people were still struggling to regain their independence from the United Kingdom until 20 century. The Irish War of Independence, started in 1919 until 1921, at last led to the independence for most of Ireland with the exception of Northern Ireland.

The IRA Irish Republican Army continued their guerrila campaigns in Northern Ireland which caused nonstop unrests in Northern Ireland from the late 60s until the 90s. Over this 30 years civil war, many Irish guerrila fighters was imprisoned in the Maze Prison outside of Belfast, Northern Island by the British military.

And then the Maze Prison Escape or the Great Escape took place on 25 September 1983. This is the biggest Prison escape in UK history with 38 Provisional IRA members escaped the maximum security, most escape proof prison in Europe. During the escape, one prison officer died of a heart attack and 20 others were injured.

Eventually all the Northern Ireland unrest subsided following the Good Friday agreement in 1998. The hard border was removed after the agreement and Irishes living in Ireland are now allowed to cross into Northern Ireland and enter the city of Belfast following the Good Friday Agreement.

### Northern Ireland and Hong Kong, Two Scars from the British Rule.

Like Ireland, Hong Kong was a colony of the British Empire. Hong Kong island became part of the Empire after the British Victory in the First Opium War in 1842. And the Hongkong Peninsula and Lantau Island also became part of the British Empire after the Second Opium war and the march on Beijing. After two Opium Wars, it became Legal to sell drugs to local Chinese citizens and soldiers without any interference from the Qing local officers.

Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, one year before the 1998 Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland. Like most borders drawn by the Britain, the North-South Ireland border or the Pakistan & India border in Kashmir will sustain local conflicts and prevent that countries or regions to ever become fully united and stable.

A destabilizing border is the best way to keep your enemies weak and divided, forever prevent the region to become a major threat to Bristish neo-colonial influence. Ireland Republic as well as the majority of Northern Ireland supports staying in the European Union and having the Euro as its currency. So if Brexits materialized, Northern Ireland will potentially once again become a major unrest flask point just like what is happening in Hong Kong.

### Future of English, The Language

The continued struggle of Northern Ireland is the result of distance between Irish and English language. Irish is a Celtic-based language while English is a Germanic based language. Borders should have been drawn based on language usage. If we can talk, the less likely we have to kill.

Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latinum. Through the power of the Roman Republic, Latin become a dominant language in Italy, and eventually entire Western Roman Empire. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, pure Latin is gradually disappearing from existence. Vulgar Latin developed into Roman languages like French, Spanish, Italian, Portagues. Latin has contributed many words to the English language. Majority of English descriptions of theology, science, medicine and law used Latin-root words. However, English is mainly a Germanic language.

The Western Civilization history is the violent struggle of the disciplined farm-based society of the South and the chaotic nomadic hunter-gatherer societies of the North. And the victors bring their gene and their languages with them to new frontiers.

British influence is erosing everywhere but the English language is still spreading like wild-fire. English is no-longer the language of British people but the language of the world. Will British English eventually disappear like Latin and English evolved into many different localized form like American English, Indian English, Singlish, Hong Kong English ?

The balance power of the North, South, East and West goes hand in hand with the position of the North Pole. With the projected location of North pole moving closer to Russia and the East, will our human civilization destiny once again decided by our earth's magnetic field. After the upcoming North-South Magnetic Field Reversal, maybe it will be different this time ?
