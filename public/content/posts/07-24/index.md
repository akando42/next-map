The Russian reviving empire effectively executed the famous CIA-style regime change, helped Donald John Trump to overpower Hillary Rodham Clinton to become the king of America with the help of fake news and social media trolls. 

By the end of the investigation, the special counsel Robert Mueller can not find enough evidence to prove that Trump campaign cheated with Russian help cause the GRU aka KGB too good at cleaning their tracks.

It is illegal to conspire with a foreign government during election. However to receive help passively without knowing about it is absolutely OK.

So this is how the shit went down according to Mueller

### Dec 28, 2016

Mike Flynn received a text from Russian ambassador. 
“Can you kindly call me back at your convenience”

Mike Flynn texted Kathleen Troia McFarland, his deputy as well as a Fox News Girl who is at the Mar-a-Lago with Trump -- “Time or a call ? Tit for tat with Russia not good. Russia AMBO reaching out to me today”

McFarland called Flynn later and told Flyn that Trump got Putin back, just do not escalate and misbehave right now. Just chill out.

Got a green light, Flyn called Russian Ambassador and told him: “Hold off, there would be a new friendlier team in the White House in just a few weeks.”

### December 30, 2016
Putin made a surprise move despite Obama’s poking. 
He just chilled out and ignored Obama
Trump tweeted “Great move on delay (by V Putin).”

### January 12, 2017
Washington Post rat Flynn out with a story saying Flynn was violating the Logan act. 

Logan act is a US federal law that put people in jail for negotiating with another Kingdoms.Only the King and his staff can talk to other kings.  Trump was not king yet as of Dec 28, 2016.

Trump was pissed, tell Reince Priebus, his chief of staff at the time, to clean up the mess.Priebus and Flynn think really hard and agree to deny the phone conversation about sanction response ever happened. 

So Flynn told Mike Pences and all his friends at White House that he did not chat with Russian ambassador about the sanction response.

### January 24, 2017
Mike Flynn met with 2 FBI agents in black suits. He told the cool agents that Washington Post’s Logan Act story was a total made-up bullshit, not true.

### January 26, 2017
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates who has access the US’s surveillance tape of Flynn and Russian Ambassador's conversation knew the truth. 

So she went to tell later resigned Donald McGahn that the US justice department knew that Flynn lied. 

Well lying does not work anymore since they have the tape so Trump, McGahn and Preibus decide to unfriend Mike Flynn. 

Also on this date, Trump grab dinner with senior adviser friends, he asked everyone what they thought off James Comey.

Dan Coats, the boss of national intelligence, said he likes James so Trump should hangout with James before he decides to unfriend or not James Comey.

### January 27, 2017
James Comey and Donald J. Trump has a dinner date at the White House. 

Trump texted Comey last minutes to tell help to grab some food and Comey felt kinda bad about not getting invited ahead of time. 

Comey got to the dinner and felt award because he thought it was going to be a group dinner. However it is a dinner for two alone in a big dark room.

Bannon and Prieus was jealous and Prieus want to join for dinner but Trump kicked him out.
During the dinner, Trump told Comey that if Comey wants to keep his job, he has to play balls.

Trump told Comey that “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty” if Comey wants to keep his job.
Comey felt awkward and scared and decide to reply vaguely “You will always get honesty from me” 

Trump corrected “That's what I want, honest loyalty”

### February 13, 2017
Mike Flynn left and stop hangout at the White House. Trump did say goodbye and gave Mike Flynn a big hug when he was walking out

### February 14, 2017
Trump met Comey again in the White House and he told Comey that Flynn has done nothing wrong

“"He's a good guy and has been through a lot. I hope you can see your way clear to letting him go, letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."

Comey really like to investigate. His childhood dream was to investigate so when Trump said that Comey can not investigate anymore if Comey wants to be Trump friend, Comey did not like it. So i wrote a Memo about the weird encounter with Trump at the White House. 

He can later tell Congress about this and have a written record.

### February 22, 2017
Priebus told McFarland, Flynn deputy, that Trump also want to unfriend her. However Trump will make McFarland the ambassador of  Singapore, a small but important country with great Asian food.

McFarland chatted with a White House lawyer about the ambassador thingy. 

The lawyer said that lying to the press is not a crime but draft an official email could be one. Also using the email as a bargain for the ambassador position does not seem to be a good idea. 

So McFarland is too scared to do it and later on does not want to be a Singapore ambassador either. 

### March 2, 2017
Jeff Sessions said he is not going to hang around Comey and spy on his investigation. 

Trump was pissed and asked McGahn, the White House counsel to chat with Sessions and tell him to man up.

Sessions was supposed to be Trump’s best friend. He should watch Comey for Trump in case Comey going to make some move on Trump.

Trump kept calling Sessions but Sessions just ignored him throughout the day.

### April 11, 2017
Trump told Fox News that no it’s not too late for him to unfriend Comey but I still kinda like Comey and want to keep Comey as Facebook friend.

Trump then Facetime Comey later that day and tell him to stop playing the investigating game again.

Trump winked at Comey and said: "Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal — we had that thing, you know," but Comey decline to stop playing games.

Trump later that afternoon call Attorney General Jeff Sessions and said:
 "This is terrible, Jeff. It's all because you recused. Attorney General is supposed to be the most important appointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you recuse yourself. You left me on an island. I can't do anything."

Jeff Sessions said maybe you can unfriend Comey and add a new friend as FBI boss. 

### April 12, 2017
Jeff Sessions handed Trump the resignation letter, offer to unfriend Trump but Trump decline the 
unfriend request. However, on that day, he finally made up his mind and decided to find a way fire and unfriend Comey. Trump called McGahn 3 times to tell him to tell acting Attorney General Rosenstein to fire Comey but McGahn kept hanging up and does not follow the order.

### May 9, 2017

### July 7, 2018

Hope Hicks, Trump’s communication director, drafted a cool story for Trump junior to tell the whole wide world: 

“It was a short meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up.”

Donald Trump Junior add “primarily” to the statement so it becomes “We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children…”

### July 19, 2017
Trump was pissed with the continuing investigation, pissed at Jeffs Sessions for not help him. 
He told the New York Times that if he knew Sessions would be a pussy and does not stand up for him then he would have appointed someone else as Attorney General. 

### July 22, 2017

### August 2018
Cohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to campaign-finance violations, based on the payoffs he had made to Daniels and the other woman and said he did that in Trump direction. 

Trump contrasted and tweet:
“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12-year-old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him, and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' — make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!"

### November 2018

Trump admitted that the discussion of the Moscow tower deal continuing throughout his campaign. 

Trump said. "There would have been nothing wrong if i did do it ... That was my business ... I was focused on running for president ... I was running my business while I was campaigning. There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would've gone back into the business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"

### November 6, 2018

US midterm election result in a split with Republican gain seats and kept the majority in Senate while the Democrat gains enough seats in the House to flip the House to Democrate Majority

Contempt of Congress is the act of obstructing the work of the United States Congress or one of its committees. Historically, the bribery of a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative was considered contempt of Congress

### July 24, 2019
Robert Mueller is a Vietnamese era Marine Corp veteran so it seems like his past experience in Vietnam affected his decision in the investigation. The impeachment of Richard Nixon essentially helps to accelerate the end of the War in Vietnam and unite the country. 

Maybe that's why Mueller was so reluctant to charge a sitting president and impeach him because it reminded him about the war in Vietnam. 

Maybe he saw Trump and Russian improving relationship as a better geo-strategic position for US in the 21 century which is too obvious to be true.

So he puts the ball on House of Democrat court and they just chicken out because of the timing escalating trade war with China. 

The Democrats can not launch impeachment during an escalating tradewar with an adversary, not like Nixon’s impeachment during a de-escalated War in Vietnam or Clinton during a peacetime.

Not sure if China or Trump administration times the escalation but it was perfect timing to
get Trump out of the target scope.

Is Russian interference in the US election in US best interest or in Russia best interest ?

Did Russia interfere in the 2016 Election or the MI6 or US own republican leaning CIA or
The Chinese or Deep Mind from Cambridge getting out of control and starting a revolution.

Not sure who but someone definitely did interfere in this irregular election ?

Trump’s continous attack on China and every other countries other than Russia is unexpectedly turning China’s image from a bougie man into a good-guy who is standing up to a bully United States under Donald Trump.

Trump’s aggression is pushing Japan, India and Germany closer to China like how Italy was pushed closer to England because of Prussian’s aggression before World War One.

Maybe Deep Mind believe China is a better policeman and should lead the world in 21 century.

Russia was armed with GOP polling data from Paul Manafort and stolen DNC game plan via hacking to execute a highly targeted and segmented Facebook ads buying to promote fake news on battleground states during 2016 election.
